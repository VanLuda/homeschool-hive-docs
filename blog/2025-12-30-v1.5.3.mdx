## What's New

### Language Filter
Find groups and events in your preferred language. A new language filter on both the Groups and Events discovery pages lets you narrow results by language, making it easier to connect with communities that match your family's needs.

### Events Map View
Browse events on an interactive map, similar to the Groups discovery page. The new Events page matches the layout you're already familiar with, featuring a split-view with list and map panels. Events cluster together at wider zoom levels and expand as you zoom in.

### Scheduled for Deletion Section
Group leaders can now see groups scheduled for deletion in a collapsible section on the My Groups page. This makes it easy to track which groups are pending removal and take action before they're permanently deleted.

### Email Verification Confirmation Page
After verifying your email address, you'll now see a dedicated confirmation page confirming your email was successfully verified. This provides clearer feedback instead of simply redirecting to the homepage.
