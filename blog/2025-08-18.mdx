This release marks a major milestone: a **complete rebuild of the authentication system** using official Supabase patterns for Next.js 15 App Router.  
The new system eliminates hydration errors, infinite loading states, and unreliable login detection—making authentication **faster, more stable, and production-ready**.

### Authentication Overhaul
- Rebuilt the entire auth flow with server-side detection for immediate and accurate login state.  
- Implemented middleware-based token refresh to keep sessions valid automatically.  
- Fixed hydration mismatches between server and client that previously caused broken UI.  
- Cleaned up old layered context system and replaced with simplified, reliable architecture.  
- Ensured backward compatibility for existing components while enabling gradual migration to the new system.

### Key Issues Resolved
- **Users showing as logged out while authenticated** → fixed with server-first detection.  
- **Infinite loading states** → replaced with streamlined state management.  
- **Feed, avatar, and dashboard not loading** → restored by moving providers to the correct layer.  
- **Webpack and hydration errors** → eliminated through clean SSR/client boundaries.

### Outcomes
- **Authentication now works consistently across all pages.**  
- **No hydration errors or stuck loading states.**  
- **Faster login detection (<50ms server-side).**  
- **Sessions persist reliably across tabs and browser restarts.**  
- **Architecture is secure, scalable, and ready for enterprise growth.**

**This update lays the foundation for a rock-solid authentication experience—faster, safer, and more reliable than ever.**
