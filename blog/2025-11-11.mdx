### 🎉 What's New

#### Scholarship Invoice Generation for Group Leaders
Group leaders can now generate professional, print-ready invoices for families using scholarship programs. Our new subscription-based system offers **5 flexible tiers** (Starter, Growth, Pro, Scale, and Unlimited) to fit groups of any size. Generate up to 50 invoices at once with our intuitive 4-step wizard that guides you through event selection, line item configuration, attendee selection, and generation.

#### Professional Invoice Management Dashboard
A complete dashboard for managing all your scholarship invoices in one place. View invoice status at a glance, filter by event or parent, update statuses through the full lifecycle (pending → downloaded → submitted → approved → paid), export to CSV for your records, and download professional PDFs ready for submission to scholarship providers.

#### Customizable Invoice Branding
Make your invoices truly yours! Upload your group's logo, add your EIN and business address, configure custom footer information with contact details, and set default instructions that appear on every invoice. All invoices are generated in professional, print-ready PDF format that meets scholarship provider requirements.

#### Parent Invoice Hub
Parents can now access **all scholarship invoices across all their groups** in one unified view. The new "Scholarship Invoices" tab in the payment dashboard provides easy filtering by status, group, or date range, instant PDF downloads, one-click submission tracking, and complete visibility into the invoice lifecycle.

#### Real-Time Usage Tracking
Group leaders get transparent visibility into their subscription usage with real-time tracking throughout the billing period, visual progress indicators showing invoices used vs. included, automatic warnings at 80% and 100% usage thresholds, and clear overage cost calculations for high-volume months.

### ✨ Improvements

#### Streamlined Invoice Submission
Parents can now download professional PDFs with one click, mark invoices as submitted directly in the platform, add notes about their scholarship provider and submission details, and track the full journey from generation through reimbursement.

#### Smart Invoice Workflows
Our intelligent 4-step wizard makes invoice generation fast and error-free with event-based invoice creation (select which event to bill), dynamic line item editor (tuition, materials, fees, activities), real-time attendee selection with instant totals, and built-in validation to prevent errors.

#### Automated Notifications
Stay informed with automated email notifications for new invoice generation, status updates as invoices progress, subscription billing and renewals, and usage warnings when approaching plan limits.

#### Flexible Subscription Management
Choose the plan that fits your group with 5 subscription tiers from 25 to unlimited invoices per month, monthly or annual billing options, easy upgrades and downgrades mid-cycle, and transparent pricing with no hidden fees.

#### Mobile-Optimized Experience
Fully responsive design works seamlessly on any device with mobile-friendly invoice viewing and management, touch-optimized controls for quick actions, and complete dark mode support throughout.
