## What's New

### Event Series

Create recurring events like courses, camps, classes, or weekly meetups with flexible attendance options. Perfect for activities that run across multiple sessions.

**Series Pass**: Families can purchase access to all sessions upfront with their spot reserved across every session. Great for committed participants who want guaranteed attendance.

**Drop-in Tickets**: Allow families to join individual sessions without committing to the full series. You can even offer special intro pricing for first-time attendees to encourage new participants.

**Session Management**: Track attendance per session with easy check-in and check-out. View attendance reports and export them for your records.

**Calendar Integration**: Sessions display clearly in calendars as "Art Class (3/8)" so families always know which session is coming up. The iCal feed includes proper series information for external calendar apps.

**Bulk Import**: Import events from external calendars using CSV files, making it easy to migrate existing schedules.

### Custom Roles & Permissions

Create custom leadership roles tailored to how your group operates. Move beyond the basic member, co-leader, and owner roles with fine-grained control over what each team member can do.

**14 Granular Permissions**: Control exactly what each role can access, from managing events and members to viewing finances and sending announcements. Mix and match permissions to create roles like "Event Coordinator" or "Membership Manager."

**Role Hierarchy**: Higher-level roles can manage lower-level roles, ensuring proper delegation without security concerns. Your leadership structure is reflected in who can assign and modify roles.

**Smart Menu Filtering**: Team members only see the admin tools relevant to their permissions, keeping the interface clean and preventing confusion.

**Easy Role Assignment**: Assign custom roles to individual members or update roles in bulk from the members list.

### Bulk Member Import

Quickly onboard large groups with CSV import supporting up to thousands of members at once. Perfect for established communities migrating to Homeschool Hive or groups with existing member lists.

**Simple CSV Format**: Upload a spreadsheet with email addresses and optional fields like name, role, and membership expiration. The system validates your file before processing.

**Progress Tracking**: Large imports process in the background with real-time progress updates. See which members were successfully invited and which had issues.

**Branded Invitation Flow**: Invited members receive your group's logo, welcome message, and any custom questions. They complete their profile, agree to rules, and pay fees (if applicable) in one seamless flow.

**Membership Expiration**: Set expiration dates for grandfathered members. The system automatically sends reminders before expiration and handles access transitions gracefully.

### Payment History

View all your payments in one organized place with detailed breakdowns.

**Unified History**: See every payment across all groups and events, with expandable details showing individual tickets, add-ons, and fees.

**Receipt Access**: Download or view receipts directly from your payment history. Scholarship invoices are available as PDFs.
