This release delivers a major restructuring of the layout system, making spacing and header behavior consistent across the platform. We’ve introduced an enterprise-grade container architecture, fixed registration/password usability issues, fully implemented advanced SEO infrastructure, refactored authentication into a single robust system, and made targeted performance optimizations to speed up loading and reduce unnecessary delays. Tab switching behavior for authenticated users has been fully stabilized.

### Layout & Spacing Improvements
- **Unified Announcement + Header Container**
  - Announcement bar and header now share a single fixed container.
  - Announcement appears above the header to eliminate overlap.
- **Dynamic Height Calculation**
  - Added `useHeaderHeight()` hook to compute total height (64px base + 40px for announcements).
  - ConditionalMain now applies dynamic `paddingTop` and `minHeight` based on actual header height.
  - Works for both SSR and client hydration.
- **Hydration Safety**
  - Server-side fallback values prevent layout shifts during initial render.
  - Smooth transition when announcements are dismissed.
- **Auth Header Alignment**
  - Changed `AuthHeader` from `py-1` to fixed `h-16` for consistent 64px height.
- **Enterprise Layout System**
  - New composable containers: `PageContainer`, `SectionContainer`, `ContentContainer`, `GridContainer`.
  - Variant-based styling, spacing system, grid patterns.
  - Accessibility-ready, responsive by default, theme compatible.

**Benefits:** Consistent spacing, dynamic announcement handling, no layout shifts, scalable for future features.

### Auth Tab Switching Fixes
- **Tab Visibility Detection**
  - Only validates sessions when tab is visible for a meaningful period.
- **Reduced Aggressiveness**
  - Extended check interval to 10 minutes.
  - Silent validations that don’t trigger loading states.
- **Realtime Manager Updates**
  - Pauses WebSocket reconnection when tab hidden.
  - 2-second delay after visibility change to prevent spam.
- **Root Cause Fix**
  - No longer triggers loading state on SIGNED_IN event for same user.

**Results:** No loading state when switching tabs briefly, reduced WebSocket errors, smoother UX.
