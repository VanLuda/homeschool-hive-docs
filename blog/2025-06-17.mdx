Hey there 👋 — I’m Carl, the founder of [Homeschool Hive](https://homeschoolhive.co/).

This platform was born out of a simple frustration: managing homeschool groups using social media and scattered tools wasn’t just inefficient — it was chaotic. Homeschool Hive was created to bring clarity, connection, and confidence to the homeschool community.

This **Changelog** is where you'll find transparent updates about what we’re building — feature launches, fixes, improvements, and the decisions behind them. Whether you're a group leader, a parent, or just curious about our progress, this space is for you.

### What to Expect

- ✨ New feature announcements
- 🐛 Bug fixes and performance improvements
- 🛠️ Infrastructure upgrades
- 📣 Sneak peeks of what’s next

Thanks for being a part of this journey. Your feedback and engagement directly shape the future of Homeschool Hive — so don’t hesitate to reach out.

Here’s to empowering families and strengthening communities — one update at a time.

Warmly,  
**Carl VanderLaan**  
Founder, Homeschool Hive
