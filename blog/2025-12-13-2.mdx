## What's New

### Event Names Clickable in Feed Posts

Event names in feed posts now link directly to the event detail page, matching the existing behavior for group names. This improves navigation and discoverability of events from the activity feed.

### Time-Limited Scholarship Invoice Links

Scholarship invoice PDF links now include time-limited access for improved security.

## Bug Fixes

### Improved Authentication Performance

Streamlined authentication code for better performance and reliability.

### Account Page Skeleton Loaders

Refactored skeleton loading states across all account pages:

- Match actual content structure more closely
- Added proper dark mode support
- Consistent card styling with rounded corners and shadows
- Updated pages: /account, /account/payments, /account/payments/methods, /account/subscriptions, /account/notifications, /account/security, /account/family

### Full Child Name on Scholarship Invoices

Fixed PDF template to display complete child name (first + last name). Previously only displayed first name, causing "Guest Account" to show as just "Guest".

### Build Reliability

Improved build process reliability for larger deployments.
