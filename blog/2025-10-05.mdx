This release brings major platform enhancements focused on mobile accessibility and local discovery. The headline feature is our new native mobile app (iOS & Android), allowing families to manage their homeschool activities on-the-go. We've added a business directory so local homeschool-friendly businesses can create profiles and host events, plus location-based discovery with radius search to help you find nearby groups and activities. Performance improvements deliver 80-90% faster feed loading, and the new event watchlist lets you bookmark interesting events for later. This release also includes numerous bug fixes and UI improvements for a smoother experience across all devices.
