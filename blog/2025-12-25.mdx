## What's New

### Simplified Onboarding System
New users now go straight to the dashboard after signup where a guided tour highlights key features and navigation. A sidebar checklist guides you through essential setup steps like uploading your avatar, adding family members, joining a group, and RSVPing to your first event. Items automatically mark as complete as you take each action, so you always know what to do next. The onboarding experience works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile.

### Nearby Groups Search
Finding groups in your area is now easier with improved geographic search. Distance calculations are more accurate, and search results include additional details like group categories and age ranges to help you find the perfect fit for your family.

### Enhanced Feed Interactions
Commenting on posts now opens a focused modal view for a more immersive conversation experience. Posts with multiple comments show a preview of recent replies so you can quickly catch up on the discussion. Public group posts can now be shared directly from the feed, with native sharing on mobile devices and one-click link copying on desktop.
