## Improvements

### Reduced Initial Page Load Time

Optimized JavaScript bundle to improve page load performance:

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Replaced animation library with CSS transitions in theme toggle | ~125KB removed from initial bundle |
| Dynamic import for homepage hero section | Deferred loading until needed |
| Lazy-load analytics module | Only loads when required |
| Animation library deferred | Now only loads when users scroll to animated sections |

### For Parents Page

Updated hero section badges to better reflect the platform's free features. Replaced confusing messaging with clearer "Free to Browse" and "Easy RSVPs" badges.

## Bug Fixes

### Free Group Checkout

Fixed an issue where joining a free group with no rules and no questions caused an infinite loading spinner. The checkout now automatically detects when there are no actionable steps and submits the membership request immediately.

### Dark Mode Badge Visibility

Fixed the "Soon" badge visibility in dark mode by changing from a transparent background to a solid color. The new styling also better differentiates it from the "Almost Full" badge.

### Payment Analytics Dashboard

- Fixed layout inconsistencies in payment analytics
- Added detailed payment type breakdowns to revenue reports
- Added platform fee and transaction count to revenue displays
- Fixed dashboard cards showing incorrect data
