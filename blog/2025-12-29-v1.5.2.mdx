## What's New

### Virtual Groups Tab
Browse online-only groups in a new dedicated tab on the Groups page. The Virtual tab displays groups without a physical location in a responsive grid layout. Infinite scroll automatically loads more groups as you browse, making it easy to explore hundreds of virtual communities without waiting for page loads.

## Improvements

- Groups and events with physical locations are now more discoverable through search engines
- Filter bar layout is more compact and fits better on smaller screens
- Virtual groups display in a 4-column responsive grid for easier browsing

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where public events from public groups required login to view
- Fixed visual flash when loading the discover page where virtual groups would briefly appear
- Fixed incorrect count shown on the Virtual tab badge
