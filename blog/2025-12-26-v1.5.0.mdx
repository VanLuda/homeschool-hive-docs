## What's New

### Video Uploads
You can now upload videos directly to your posts. Simply drag and drop a video file or click to select one, and it will be automatically processed into multiple quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p) for smooth playback on any connection. The video player lets you choose your preferred quality and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile. Video uploads are currently available to platform administrators as we prepare for wider rollout.

### Platform Announcements
Platform administrators can now create broadcast posts that appear in every user's feed. These announcements are visually distinguished with a purple "Platform" badge and Homeschool Hive branding. Administrators can optionally disable comments on announcements when appropriate. Posts appear naturally in chronological order alongside regular feed content.

### Rich Link Previews
When you paste a URL into a post, Homeschool Hive now automatically detects it and shows a preview card with the page thumbnail, title, and domain. The preview appears as you type, giving you a preview of how the link will look before posting. Video links from popular platforms are recognized for enhanced display.
