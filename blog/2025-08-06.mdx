## What's New

Stay informed your way with a unified notification system supporting in-app alerts, email notifications, and push notifications. Notifications are now faster and more efficient, only updating you about what matters.

### Improved Group Join Workflow
- Free groups now notify admins immediately when someone requests to join
- Group admins can approve or deny membership requests directly from the platform
- Join requests for moderated groups route through a centralized approval interface

### Custom 404 Page
Visitors who land on a broken link now see a helpful error page instead of a generic browser error.
