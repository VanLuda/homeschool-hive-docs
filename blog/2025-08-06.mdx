This release brings major upgrades across several key areas of the platform. We’ve enhanced the real-time notification system to be faster, smarter, and more efficient—supporting in-app, email, and push delivery. Auth flows (like registration and password recovery) now work as intended, with smoother redirection post-login. Group pages now redirect cleanly to human-readable slugs for better SEO and sharing. Several UI polish items were also addressed to make the experience more consistent across devices and themes.

### General Enhancements
- Dark mode now renders correctly across all remaining pages.
- A custom 404 page has been added for improved error handling and user experience.
- User avatar images now display correctly using the updated image path.

### Notifications Enhancements
- Fully migrated to a unified, multi-channel notification service supporting:
  - In-app notifications
  - Push notifications
  - Email notifications
- Improved performance and efficiency:
  - Subscriptions clean up automatically after 30 seconds of inactivity.
  - Tabs that are minimized or backgrounded disconnect from real-time updates.
  - Subscriptions only listen to relevant database columns to reduce noise.
  - Multiple components now share a single subscription to minimize overhead.
- Added internal monitoring tools for subscription health and connection counts.
- Fixed a bug where “Mark all as read” wasn’t updating the interface correctly.

### Auth Page Enhancements
- Added support for redirect URLs after login and registration (e.g., returning users to their intended destination).
- Fixed the user registration flow, which now completes successfully.
- Fixed the forgot password flow, which now properly sends recovery emails and allows password resets.

### Event Page Enhancements
- Updated event schema to include all structured data fields recommended by Google for search visibility.
- Resolved a hydration error caused by nested `<button>` tags in the `EventCategorySelector` component.

### Group Page Enhancements
- Group UUID URLs now redirect (HTTP 307) to their slug-based equivalents for cleaner, SEO-friendly URLs.
  - Example: `/groups/347bd7ad...` redirects to `/groups/homeschool-hangouts`
  - This maintains link compatibility while improving readability and search performance.
- Refined the Join Group CTA:
  - Removed unused description text.
  - Displays "Free to join" for free groups.
  - Shows actual membership pricing pulled from the database.
- Group member counts now show accurately across group listings and detail pages.
- Improved the group join request workflow:
  - Free groups immediately notify admins upon request.
  - Moderated groups route all join requests to a centralized approval interface.
  - Group admins can now approve or deny requests directly from the platform.

### Developer Enhancements
- Implemented comprehensive error tracking:
  - React error boundaries for key components.
  - Automatic client- and server-side error capture.
  - Validation and API errors are now consistently tracked.
