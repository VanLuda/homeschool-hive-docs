## What's New

### Group Deletion & Data Export

Group leaders can now safely close their groups when needed. The deletion process includes a 14-day grace period, giving you time to change your mind if circumstances change.

**What happens when you close a group:**
- All members receive notifications about the upcoming closure
- Active subscriptions are automatically cancelled with pro-rated refunds
- Upcoming events are cancelled and attendees receive refunds
- You can download a complete export of your group's data (members, events, financials, and posts)
- A countdown banner shows how much time remains before permanent deletion

Access group deletion from the Danger Zone in your group settings. You'll need to confirm by entering your password and the group name.

### Reliable Profile Pictures

Profile pictures from social logins (like Facebook and Google) now stay visible permanently. Previously, some profile pictures would disappear after their temporary links expired. Your profile picture is now stored securely and will always display correctly.
