## What's New

### Dynamic Group Discovery Map
The groups map now loads dynamically as you explore. Pan and zoom to any area and groups will appear automatically, no longer limited to a fixed search radius. Groups load seamlessly as you move around the map, with faster initial loading so you see nearby groups instantly. Click a group card to center it on the map, or click "View Group" to go directly to the group page.

### Smart Filter Indicators
When you have filters active in the "More Filters" section, you'll now see a badge showing how many filters are applied. This makes it clear when filters are affecting your search results.

### Marketing Attribution
We now track how users find Homeschool Hive through marketing campaigns. If you arrive via a promotional link, we'll remember that when you register to help us understand which outreach efforts are most effective.
