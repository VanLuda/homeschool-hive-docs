## What's New

### Event Terms System

Group leaders can now create and manage terms that attendees must accept during event registration:

- **Term Templates**: Create reusable term templates at the group level with support for variables that auto-fill group name, event name, and event date
- **Event Terms Section**: Add terms to any event with drag-and-drop reordering and the ability to mark each term as required or optional
- **Checkout Integration**: All required terms must be accepted before proceeding with payment
- **Platform Terms**: Platform-wide terms are now version-tracked and stored in user profiles
- **Admin Tools**: View which attendees accepted which terms and export terms data with your attendee lists

Access Event Terms from the new menu item in your group settings sidebar.

### Checkout Receipt Emails

After completing registration, attendees now receive professional receipt emails with complete order details:

- Itemized ticket and add-on breakdown with quantity, item name, and price
- Clear payment summary showing subtotal, platform fee, processing fee, and total
- Single calendar subscription link for easy event tracking
- Sent immediately after RSVP for all payment types including free events and scholarship bookings

### Scholarship Dashboard Improvements

The scholarship invoice dashboard now makes it easier to manage invoices:

- Click invoice numbers to view PDFs directly in your browser
- Hover over invoices to reveal a quick button for marking them as received
- Child names now display correctly for all invoice types

### Unified Payment Tracking

All payment types (event registrations, subscriptions, and memberships) are now tracked in a unified system, enabling better reporting and payment history across your groups.
