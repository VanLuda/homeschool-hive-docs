### How Calendar Syncing Works

Understanding the sync process helps set expectations:

- **Automatic Updates**: Your calendar app checks for changes periodically (usually every 15 minutes to several hours)
- **New RSVPs**: When you RSVP to an event, it will appear in your subscribed calendar within the next sync cycle
- **Cancelled Events**: If an event is cancelled or you change your RSVP, it will be removed from your calendar
- **Series Sessions**: All sessions in a recurring series appear as individual events with session numbers
- **Event Changes**: Updates to event times, locations, or details sync automatically

:::tip Refresh Frequency
Most calendar apps refresh subscribed calendars every few hours by default. Check your calendar app's settings if you need more frequent updates.
:::

### Managing Your Calendar Subscription

If you suspect your calendar feed URL has been shared or compromised:

1. Open the Calendar Subscription modal
2. Click **Regenerate URL**
3. Update your calendar app subscriptions with the new URL

:::warning Old URL Stops Working
When you regenerate your URL, the old one immediately stops working. Make sure to update all calendar apps where you've added the subscription.
:::

#### Revoke Access

To completely disable your calendar feed:
