# RSVP for Events

This guide explains how to register your family for events, select tickets, and manage your RSVPs.

## RSVP Process Overview

Registering for an event involves:

1. Selecting tickets (if applicable)
2. Choosing attendees from your family
3. Providing required information
4. Completing payment (for paid events)

Events can be either in-person or virtual. Virtual events provide meeting links for easy online participation, while in-person events include location details.

## Register for a Free Event

For events with no cost:

1. Click on the event to view details
2. Click **RSVP**
3. Select which family members are attending
4. Click **Confirm RSVP**
5. You'll see a confirmation message

## Register for a Paid Event

For events with registration fees:

1. Click on the event to view details
2. Click **Register** or **Get Tickets**
3. Select your tickets:
   - Choose ticket type(s)
   - Set quantity for each
   - Add any optional add-ons
4. Click **Continue to Checkout**
5. Enter attendee information:
   - Select family members attending
   - Provide any required details (ages, allergies, emergency contacts)
6. Choose your payment method
7. Review your order summary
8. Click **Complete Registration**

### Ticket Reservations

When you proceed to checkout, your selected tickets are automatically reserved for you. This ensures that tickets remain available while you complete your registration.

**How ticket reservations work:**

- Once you click **Continue to Checkout**, your tickets are temporarily held
- A reservation timer appears showing how long you have to complete your purchase
- Other members cannot claim your reserved tickets during this time
- If the timer expires before you complete checkout, the tickets are automatically released back to availability

:::tip Complete Checkout Promptly
The reservation timer gives you enough time to fill out your information without rushing, but don't wait too long. If you need to step away, you may need to restart the checkout process to reserve tickets again.
:::

**Benefits of ticket reservations:**

- **No double-booking** - You won't lose tickets to someone else while filling out forms
- **Fair access** - Everyone gets the same amount of time to complete their purchase
- **Prevents capacity conflicts** - Eliminates situations where you finish checkout but tickets have sold out
- **Stress-free registration** - Focus on providing accurate information without worrying about ticket availability

### Understanding Tickets

Events may offer different ticket types:

- **General Admission** - Standard entry
- **Child Ticket** - Reduced price for children
- **Adult Ticket** - For parents/guardians
- **Family Pass** - Covers the whole family

### Add-Ons

Some events offer optional add-ons:

- **Per-Attendee Add-ons** - Purchased for each person (e.g., lunch, materials)
- **Per-Order Add-ons** - Purchased once per registration (e.g., parking pass)

## Registration Requirements

Event organizers may require specific information:

- **Attendee Names** - Who is attending
- **Ages** - Age of each attendee
- **Allergies** - Food or environmental allergies
- **Emergency Contact** - Who to call in an emergency
- **Special Needs** - Any accommodations required

:::tip

## Join Virtual Events

Homeschool Hive supports both in-person and virtual events, making it easy to participate in online classes, co-op meetings, and virtual field trips.

### Identifying Virtual Events

Virtual events are clearly marked with a special indicator:

- Look for the **Virtual** badge on event cards in the event discovery feed
- Virtual events display a distinct icon to differentiate them from in-person gatherings
- Event details page shows whether the event is virtual or in-person

### Accessing Meeting Links

Once you've registered for a virtual event:

1. **After Registration** - You'll receive confirmation with virtual event details
2. **Find Your Link**:
   - Go to **Events** > **My Events**
   - Click on your virtual event
   - The meeting link appears in the event details
3. **Join the Event**:
   - Click the one-click **Join Meeting** button
   - You'll be taken directly to the virtual meeting platform

:::note Meeting Link Timing
Some group leaders may hide meeting links until shortly before the event begins. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. If you don't see a link yet, check back closer to the event start time.
:::

### Virtual Event Tips

- **Test Your Setup** - Join a few minutes early to test your camera, microphone, and connection
- **Check Requirements** - Some virtual events may require specific software or browser settings
- **Have Backup Access** - Save the meeting link in case you need to rejoin
- **Arrive on Time** - Virtual events often start promptly since there's no travel time needed

:::tip Easy Access
Bookmark your **My Events** page for quick access to all your virtual meeting links. This is especially helpful if you attend regular virtual co-op sessions or classes.
