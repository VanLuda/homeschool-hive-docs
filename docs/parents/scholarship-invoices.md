# Scholarship Invoices

If your family uses education scholarship programs (such as ESA, school choice, or other scholarship funds), Homeschool Hive makes it easy to track invoices and submit them for reimbursement.

## What Are Scholarship Invoices?

Scholarship invoices are professional, itemized invoices generated by group leaders for activities your family has participated in. These invoices can be submitted to your scholarship provider for reimbursement.

## Accessing Your Invoices

To view all your scholarship invoices:

1. Go to **Account Settings**
2. Click **Scholarship Invoices**
3. View all invoices across all your groups

## Understanding Invoice Status

Each invoice has a status that tracks its progress:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Invoice generated, not yet submitted |
| **Submitted** | You've marked it as submitted to your provider |
| **Processing** | Your scholarship provider is reviewing it |
| **Received** | Reimbursement has been received |
| **Rejected** | The invoice was not approved |

## Viewing Invoice Details

Click on any invoice to see:

- **Invoice Number** - Unique identifier
- **Date** - When the invoice was generated
- **Group** - Which group generated the invoice
- **Event** - The activity or event covered
- **Child Name** - Which child the invoice is for
