## Account Security

### Two-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Homeschool Hive account by requiring both your password and a verification code to sign in.

#### What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (also called MFA or 2FA) protects your account with two forms of verification:

1. **Something you know** - Your password
2. **Something you have** - A verification code from your authenticator app

This means that even if someone knows your password, they can't access your account without your phone or authenticator app.

:::tip Group Leaders
If you're a group leader, we strongly recommend enabling MFA to protect your account and your members' data. MFA is required for group leaders who accept payments.
:::

#### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

To enable MFA on your account:

1. Go to **Account Settings** > **Security**
2. Scroll to the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
3. Click **Enable**
4. The setup wizard will appear with two steps:

**Step 1: Scan QR Code**
- Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, 1Password, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or similar)
- Tap the "+" or "Add Account" button in the app
- Scan the QR code displayed on screen
- If you can't scan the code, tap "Can't scan?" to reveal the manual entry code
- Copy the code and enter it manually in your authenticator app
- Click **I've scanned the code**

**Step 2: Verify Setup**
- Your authenticator app will now display a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds
- Enter the current code shown in your app
- Click **Verify & Enable**

Once verified, you'll see a success message and MFA will be enabled on your account.

:::note Supported Authenticator Apps
You can use any TOTP-compatible authenticator app, including:
- Google Authenticator
- 1Password
- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Bitwarden
- LastPass Authenticator
:::

#### Using MFA During Login

After enabling MFA, your login process will include an additional step:

1. Go to the Homeschool Hive login page
2. Enter your **email** and **password** as normal
3. Click **Sign In**
4. You'll be redirected to the Two-Factor Authentication page
5. Open your authenticator app
6. Enter the current 6-digit code (codes refresh every 30 seconds)
7. Click **Verify**

You'll then be logged in and redirected to your destination.

:::tip Timing Matters
Verification codes expire every 30 seconds. If a code doesn't work, wait for the next code to appear in your authenticator app and try again.
:::

#### Recovery Options

If you lose access to your authenticator app:

**Option 1: Use a Different Account**
- Click **Sign in with a different account** on the MFA verification page
- Log out and sign in with another account if available

**Option 2: Contact Support**
- If you're locked out of your account, contact Homeschool Hive support
- For security purposes, you'll need to verify your identity
- Support can help you disable MFA and regain access

:::warning Keep Your Authenticator App Secure
- Back up your authenticator app if your app supports cloud sync (1Password, Authy, etc.)
- When getting a new phone, transfer your authenticator codes before wiping your old device
- Some apps provide recovery codes or backup options - keep these in a safe place
:::

#### Disabling Two-Factor Authentication

To turn off MFA:

1. Go to **Account Settings** > **Security**
2. Scroll to the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
3. Click **Disable**
4. A confirmation dialog will appear
5. Review the warning message
6. Click **Disable MFA** to confirm

Your account will no longer require verification codes when signing in.

:::danger Group Leader Warning
