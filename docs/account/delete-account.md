# Delete Your Account

If you decide to leave Homeschool Hive, you can delete your account. This guide explains the process and what happens to your data.

## Before You Delete

### Consider These Alternatives

Before deleting, you might want to:

### What You'll Lose

Deleting your account permanently removes:

### What Remains

Some data may be retained:

- Transaction records (required for financial/legal purposes)
- Data in group records that doesn't identify you personally
- Anonymized data used for platform statistics

## Cancel Subscriptions First

If you have active paid memberships:

1. Go to each group you're a paying member of
2. Cancel your membership
3. Wait for the cancellation to process
4. Then proceed with account deletion

:::warning Active Subscriptions
If you delete your account with active subscriptions, you won't receive refunds for unused time. Cancel memberships first to avoid unexpected charges.
