# Create a Group

This guide walks you through creating your own homeschool group on Homeschool Hive, from basic setup to configuring membership options.

## Before You Start

Before creating your group, consider:

- **Group Purpose** - What is the focus of your group?
- **Membership Model** - Will membership be free or paid?
- **Privacy Level** - Should anyone be able to join, or do you want to approve members?
- **Location** - Will you meet in person or online?

## Start Creating Your Group

1. Click **Groups** in the navigation
2. Click **Create Group**
3. Follow the multi-step setup process

## Step 1: Basic Information

### Group Name

Choose a clear, descriptive name that helps families understand what your group is about.

**Examples:**
- "Westside Homeschool Co-op"
- "Nature Explorers Field Trip Group"
- "Classical Conversations - Springfield"

### Group Type

Select how your group operates:

- **Local Group** - Your group meets at physical locations
- **Online Group** - Your group operates virtually without in-person meetings

### Privacy Setting

Choose who can see and join your group:

**Public Group**
- Anyone can find your group
- Group details are visible to everyone
- Members can join directly (free) or through checkout (paid)

**Private Group**
- Group appears in search results
- Limited details visible until approved
- Members must request to join and be approved

### Visibility (Private Groups Only)

For private groups, choose visibility:

- **Visible** - Group appears in search results, but details are limited
- **Hidden** - Group doesn't appear in search; members join via invite link only

### Location (Local Groups)

For local groups, set your meeting location:

1. Start typing your address or city
2. Select from the autocomplete suggestions
3. Adjust the map pin if needed

This helps families find groups in their area.

## Step 2: Membership Settings

### Free vs. Paid Membership

**Free Membership**
- No cost for members to join
- Best for informal groups or groups funded other ways

**Paid Membership**
- Set a membership fee
- Best for co-ops, organizations with expenses

### Membership Pricing (Paid Groups)

If you choose paid membership:

1. **Price** - Set your membership fee amount
2. **Billing Cycle** - Choose how often members are charged:
   - **Monthly** - Recurring monthly payment
   - **Annual** - One payment per year

:::tip Pricing Strategy
Annual memberships often provide better value for members and more predictable income for your group. Consider offering a small discount for annual vs. monthly payments.

### Membership Questions (Optional)

Add questions that applicants must answer when requesting to join:

3. Make it required or optional

These help you evaluate applicants before approving them.
