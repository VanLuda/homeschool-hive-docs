## Manage RSVPs

### View RSVP Status

Each attendee has a status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Confirmed** | Registered and paid (if applicable) |
| **Pending** | Started registration but not completed |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled their registration |
| **Waitlisted** | On the waitlist |

2. Enter their information
3. Select ticket type
4. Mark payment as collected (if applicable)

### Cancel a Registration

If an attendee needs to be removed:

3. View when they joined the waitlist

### How Waitlist Promotion Works

When a spot opens (someone cancels):

1. The first person on the waitlist is notified
2. They have a limited time to claim the spot
3. If they don't respond, the next person is notified
4. This continues until the spot is filled

### Manually Promote from Waitlist

To bypass automatic promotion:

1. Go to the waitlist
2. Find the person you want to promote
3. Click **Promote to Attendee**
4. They'll receive a notification to complete registration

### Remove from Waitlist

1. Find the person in the waitlist
2. Click **Remove from Waitlist**
3. Confirm the removal

## Capacity Management

### Adjust Capacity

If you need to change event capacity:

1. Go to **Edit Event**
2. Update the capacity number
3. Save changes

:::note Increasing Capacity
If you increase capacity and there's a waitlist, the system will automatically notify waitlisted people about available spots.
:::

### Close Registration Early

To stop accepting registrations before the event:

1. Go to **Edit Event**
2. Set **Registration Deadline** to now
3. Or toggle **Registration Closed**

3. Collect payment if required
4. Add them to the attendee list

### Handle No-Shows

After the event, you can track who attended:

If payment shows as pending:

1. Check with the attendee about their payment method
2. Review any error messages in the transaction
3. The attendee may need to retry payment
4. Contact support for unresolved issues

### Need to Issue Refunds
