## Event Day

### Handle Walk-Ins

If someone wants to attend who isn't registered:

1. Check if there's available capacity
2. Use **Add Attendee** to register them on the spot
3. Collect payment if required
4. Add them to the attendee list

## After the Event

### View Event Summary

After your event concludes:

1. Go to the event page
2. View the summary:
   - Total registrations
   - Actual attendance
   - Revenue collected
   - Waitlist count

### Request Feedback

Get feedback from attendees:

1. Go to **Manage Event**
2. Click **Request Feedback**
3. Attendees receive a survey request
4. View responses in your dashboard

### Copy Event for Next Time

If you're running this event again:

1. Go to the event page
2. Click **Copy Event** or **Duplicate**
3. Update the date and details
4. Publish the new event

:::tip Consider Using Event Series
If you're running the same event multiple times on a regular schedule, consider creating an [Event Series](/docs/group-leaders/event-series) instead of duplicating individual events. Series events make it easier to manage recurring activities.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Attendee Can't Register

Common causes:
- Event is at capacity (check waitlist settings)
- Registration deadline passed
- Payment method issues
- Not a group member (for members-only events)

### Payment Not Received

If payment shows as pending:

1. Check with the attendee about their payment method
2. Review any error messages in the transaction
3. The attendee may need to retry payment
4. Contact support for unresolved issues

### Need to Issue Refunds

See [Payments](/docs/group-leaders/payments-stripe) for refund procedures.
