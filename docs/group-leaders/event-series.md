# Event Series

Event Series let you create recurring activities like weekly classes, monthly workshops, or ongoing programs. Parents can purchase a series pass for all sessions or drop in to individual sessions.

## What Are Event Series?

An event series is a collection of related sessions that repeat on a schedule. Common examples include:

- **Weekly art classes** - 8 sessions over 2 months
- **Monthly book clubs** - 6 sessions across a semester
- **Bi-weekly science labs** - 12 sessions for a term
- **Daily summer camps** - 5 consecutive sessions

With event series, you can:

- Set up all sessions at once with automatic date generation
- Offer series passes for attendees who want all sessions
- Allow drop-in attendance for individual sessions
- Track attendance across the entire series
- Manage capacity for each session

## Creating a Series Event

### Start with Basic Event Details

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Create Event**
3. Fill in the event basics:
   - Event title (e.g., "Fall Art Class Series")
   - Start date and time for the first session
   - End time
   - Location or virtual meeting details
   - Description

### Enable Event Series

1. Find the **Event Series** card
2. Toggle the switch to enable series mode
3. The card expands to show series configuration options

### Configure the Schedule

**Frequency Options:**

| Frequency | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Weekly | Repeats every week |
| Bi-weekly | Repeats every 2 weeks |
| Monthly | Repeats once per month |
| Daily | Repeats every day |

**For weekly events**, you can select which days of the week:

1. Click on the day circles (S, M, T, W, T, F, S)
2. Selected days appear highlighted in blue
3. Sessions will be created for each selected day

### Set the Number of Sessions

1. Enter the total number of sessions (2-52)
2. Use quick presets: 4, 6, 8, or 12 sessions
3. The preview updates to show all session dates

### Preview and Adjust Dates

The session preview shows:

- Session number
- Date and time for each session
- Status (included or excluded)

**To exclude specific dates** (holidays, conflicts, etc.):

1. Find the date in the preview list
2. Click the **X** button next to that date
3. The date appears crossed out
4. Sessions are renumbered automatically

:::tip Planning Around Holidays
Before publishing, review your session dates and exclude any that fall on holidays or school breaks. This saves you from editing sessions later.

## Series Passes vs Drop-In Tickets

Event series support two types of attendance:

### Series Pass

A series pass grants access to all sessions in the series:

- **One purchase** covers the entire series
- Typically offers a **discounted rate** compared to drop-in
- Pass holders are **automatically reserved** for each session
- Ideal for committed attendees who plan to attend every session

### Drop-In Tickets

Drop-in tickets are for individual session attendance:

- Purchased **per session**
- Usually priced higher per session than the series pass rate
- Subject to **session capacity** after series pass holders
- Great for families who want to try a session or can't commit to the full series

### Setting Up Ticket Types

When creating tickets for a series event:

1. Click **Add Tickets** or **Manage Tickets**
2. Create a **Series Pass** ticket:
   - Name it clearly (e.g., "Full Series Pass - 8 Sessions")
   - Set the total price for all sessions
   - Optionally limit quantity
   - Check **Series Pass** option
3. Create **Drop-In** tickets:
   - Name each ticket type (e.g., "Single Session - Adult")
   - Set the per-session price
   - These tickets are available for individual sessions

:::note Pricing Strategy
Many groups price the series pass at a 10-20% discount compared to buying all sessions individually. For example, if drop-in is $15/session for 8 sessions ($120 total), the series pass might be $99.

## Series Pass Check-In

Track attendance for series pass holders across all sessions.

### How Check-In Works

1. Series pass holders are reserved for each session
2. At each session, mark them as checked in
3. Track their attendance across the series
4. See who attended which sessions

For detailed check-in instructions, see [Check-In & Attendance](/docs/group-leaders/check-in).

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Series

- **Set realistic session counts** - Start with 4-8 sessions if it's your first series
- **Build in buffer dates** - Exclude potential conflict dates upfront
- **Consider your audience** - Weekly works for committed groups; bi-weekly gives more flexibility

### Pricing Strategy

- **Value the series pass** - Make it clearly worthwhile to commit
- **Price drop-ins fairly** - Not so high they discourage attendance, not so low they undercut the pass
- **Consider intro sessions** - Some groups offer the first session at a special rate

### Communication

- **Clarify expectations** - Explain what the series pass includes
- **Send reminders** - Use session reminders to keep attendance high
- **Provide session recaps** - Help pass holders who miss a session stay caught up
