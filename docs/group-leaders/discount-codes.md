# Discount Codes

Discount codes help you offer special promotions, early bird pricing, or member benefits for your events and group memberships.

## Overview

Discount codes allow you to:
- Offer percentage or fixed-amount discounts
- Create promotional campaigns for events or memberships
- Reward early sign-ups or loyal members
- Control usage with limits and expiration dates
- Track redemption and revenue impact

## Accessing Discount Codes

1. Navigate to your **Group Settings**
2. Click **Discount Codes** in the sidebar
3. View all your active and inactive codes

## Creating Discount Codes

### Basic Setup

1. Click **Create Code** button
2. Enter a unique code identifier (e.g., SUMMER2024, WELCOME10)
3. Add an optional description for your own reference

:::tip Code Naming
Use uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. Make codes memorable and relevant to the promotion (e.g., EARLYBIRD, NEWMEMBER, SPRING25).
:::

### Code Identifier Requirements

- **Length:** 3-50 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, underscores (_), hyphens (-)
- **Case:** Automatically converted to uppercase
- **Must be unique** within your group

## Discount Types

Choose the type of discount that best fits your promotion:

### Percentage Discount

Reduces the price by a percentage:
- Enter a value between 1-100
- Examples: 10% off, 25% off, 50% off
- Best for flexible pricing across different ticket types

**Example:** A 20% code on a $50 ticket = $10 discount

### Fixed Amount Discount

Reduces the price by a specific dollar amount:
- Enter amount in dollars (up to $10,000)
- Examples: $5 off, $10 off, $25 off
- Best for consistent savings regardless of price

**Example:** A $10 code on a $50 ticket = $40 final price

:::note Fee Calculations
Discounts are applied to the subtotal before platform and processing fees are calculated.
:::

## Applies To: Events vs. Memberships

Each discount code can apply to either events or memberships:

### Events Only

- Code works for event ticket purchases
- Can be limited to specific events or all events
- Applies once at checkout

### Memberships Only

- Code works for joining your group
- Reduces membership fees
- Includes duration options (see below)

:::warning Important
A discount code cannot apply to both events and memberships. Choose one type when creating the code.
:::

## Membership Discount Duration

When creating a membership discount, specify how long the discount applies:

### First Payment Only

- Discount applied only to the initial membership payment
- Subsequent renewals are full price
- **Best for:** Welcome offers, new member incentives

**Example:** "WELCOME50" gives 50% off first month only

### All Payments (Forever)

- Discount applies to every billing cycle
- Continues indefinitely for that member
- **Best for:** Permanent member benefits, scholarships

**Example:** "VIP25" gives 25% off every month forever

### Limited Months

- Discount applies for a specific number of months (1-36)
- After the limit, member pays full price
- **Best for:** Trial periods, promotional campaigns

**Example:** "SPRING3" gives discount for first 3 months only

:::tip Strategic Use
Use "First Payment Only" to attract new members, "Limited Months" for promotions, and "Forever" sparingly for special cases like board members or volunteers.
:::

## Limiting to Specific Events

For event discount codes, you can:

### Apply to All Events

- Leave event selection empty
- Code works on any event in your group
- **Best for:** Group-wide promotions

### Apply to Specific Events

1. Select one or more events from the list
2. Code only works on those events
3. **Best for:** Event-specific early bird pricing

**Example Use Cases:**
- Early bird code for summer camp only
- Member discount for field trips only
- Partner organization discount for specific workshops

## Usage Limits

Control how many times your code can be used:

### Unlimited

- No restrictions on usage
- Code can be used indefinitely (until expired)
- **Best for:** General promotions, member benefits

### Per Member

- Each member can use the code a specific number of times
- Example: 3 uses per member
- **Best for:** Preventing abuse while allowing flexibility
- Tracks usage per user account

### Total Uses

- Code becomes inactive after X total uses
- Example: First 50 people to use the code
- **Best for:** Flash sales, limited promotions
- Creates urgency

**Current Uses Tracking:**
The system automatically tracks how many times each code has been used and displays current usage vs. limits.

## Member-Only Codes

For event discount codes, you can restrict usage:

### Member-Only Enabled

- Only active group members can use the code
- Non-members see an error message
- **Best for:** Member perks, early access

### Available to Everyone

- Anyone can use the code, including non-members
- **Best for:** Public promotions, attracting new families

:::note Membership Codes
Membership discount codes cannot be member-only (since they're used when joining the group).
:::

## Expiration Dates

Set when codes stop working:

1. **No Expiration:** Code works indefinitely
2. **Specific Date:** Select calendar date when code expires
3. **Automatic Expiration:** Code automatically deactivates on expiration date

:::tip Best Practice
Always set expiration dates for promotional codes to create urgency and control costs.

## Best Practices

### Strategic Discount Amounts

**Events:**

- New members: 25-50% first payment
- Promotional periods: 10-20% for 3-6 months
- Partner discounts: 15-30% ongoing
- Trial offers: 50% off first month

### Managing Costs

1. **Set usage limits** to control total discount impact
2. **Use expiration dates** to create urgency

4. **Adjust based on results** - increase limits if underused, decrease if costly

### Code Organization

- **Naming convention:** Use consistent patterns (SEASON-YEAR, PURPOSE-AMOUNT)
- **Descriptions:** Note the campaign or purpose for your records
- **Regular cleanup:** Archive or delete old codes periodically

### Promotional Campaigns

## Troubleshooting

### Code Not Working for Members

**Check:**

- Has it expired?
- Is the usage limit reached?
- Does it apply to events/memberships correctly?
- Is it member-only and user isn't a member?
- Does it apply to that specific event (if event-restricted)?

### Discount Not Applied Correctly

**Verify:**
- Discount type (percentage vs. fixed amount)
- Amount is correct
- Fees are calculated after discount
- Member is looking at the right line item

### Cannot Edit Code

**Common reasons:**
- Not a group owner or co-leader
- Code was deleted
- Browser cache issue (try refreshing)
