# Scholarship Invoices

Many homeschool families use education scholarship programs (ESA, school choice programs, etc.) to fund their educational activities. Homeschool Hive allows you to generate professional invoices that families can submit for reimbursement.

## What Are Scholarship Invoices?

Scholarship invoices are professional, itemized documents that:

- Detail educational activities and their costs
- Include your group's business information
- Meet requirements of scholarship providers
- Can be downloaded as PDFs by parents
- Track submission and reimbursement status
