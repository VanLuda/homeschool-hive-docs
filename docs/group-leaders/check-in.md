# Check-In & Attendance

The check-in feature helps you track who attends your events in real-time. Whether you're running a single event or a multi-session series, you can manage attendance, generate reports, and gather valuable data for future planning.

## Why Track Attendance?

Tracking attendance helps you:

- **Verify who attended** - Confirm registrations against actual attendance
- **Monitor engagement** - See which events have strong turnout
- **Plan future events** - Use attendance data to guide scheduling and pricing
- **Generate reports** - Create records for co-ops, scholarship programs, or grant requirements
- **Identify trends** - Track attendance patterns across a series

## Accessing Check-In

### For Single Events

1. Navigate to your event page
2. Click **Manage Event** in the event menu
3. Select **Check-In** or **Attendance** from the admin panel
4. The check-in interface opens with all registered attendees

### For Series Events

1. Go to your series event page
2. Click **Manage Series**
3. Find the specific session you want to check in
4. Click **Check-In** for that session

## Understanding the Check-In Interface

The check-in interface displays:

### Stats Overview

At the top, you'll see four key metrics:

- **Total** - Total number of registered attendees
- **Checked In** - How many have been marked as checked in
- **Pending** - Attendees not yet checked in
- **No Show** - Attendees marked as no-show

### Progress Bar

A visual indicator shows your check-in progress:
- Green bar fills as you check in attendees
- Percentage shows completion rate
- Updates in real-time as you check in people

### Attendee List

Each attendee row shows:

- **Name and avatar** - Visual identification
- **Access type badge** - Shows "Series Pass" or ticket type
- **Status** - Current check-in status with timestamp if checked in
- **Action buttons** - Quick access to check-in actions

## Checking In Attendees

### Standard Check-In

As attendees arrive:

1. **Search for the attendee** - Use the search bar to quickly find their name
2. **Click "Check In"** - The green button next to their name
3. **Confirmation appears** - Status updates to show check-in time
4. **Timestamp recorded** - The exact check-in time is saved

The system automatically records:
- Check-in timestamp
- Who performed the check-in (your user account)
- Updated attendance statistics

:::note First to Arrive
Check yourself in first to test the system and ensure everything is working before attendees arrive.

### Filtering Attendees

Use the status filter buttons to narrow the list:

- **All** - View everyone registered
- **Pending** - Only show attendees who haven't checked in yet
- **Checked In** - Only show attendees who are checked in
- **No Show** - Only show attendees marked as no-show

This is especially helpful for large events where you want to see who's still missing.

### Searching for Attendees

The search bar lets you:

1. Type any part of an attendee's name
2. Results filter instantly as you type
3. Case-insensitive search
4. Clear the search to see all attendees again

**Quick tip:** At busy events, have attendees tell you their name, search, and check them in within seconds.

## Undoing Check-Ins

If you accidentally check someone in:

1. Find the attendee in the list
2. Click the **Undo** button (appears after check-in)
3. Their status returns to "Pending"
4. The check-in timestamp is removed

This is useful if:
- You checked in the wrong person
- Someone checked in but then left before the event started
- You need to correct a mistake

## Marking No-Shows

After the event starts, you may want to mark registered attendees who didn't arrive:

1. Find the attendee in the "Pending" list
2. Click the **X icon** (Mark as No Show)
3. Their status changes to "No Show"

**Why mark no-shows?**
- Helps track attendance patterns
- Useful for waitlist management
- Provides data for future capacity planning
- May be required for scholarship or grant reporting

:::note Resetting No-Shows
If someone arrives late and was marked as no-show, click the **Reset** button to return them to pending status, then check them in normally.
:::

## Series Pass Check-In

For event series, series pass holders appear in the check-in list for each session.

### How It Works

1. **Series pass holders are pre-reserved** for all sessions
2. **Each session has its own check-in** - attendance is tracked per session
3. **Badge identifies pass holders** - Look for the blue "Series Pass" badge
4. **Drop-in attendees appear separately** - Shown with their ticket type

### Checking In Series Pass Holders

The process is identical to checking in regular attendees:

1. Find the series pass holder in the list
2. Click **Check In**
3. Their attendance is recorded for this specific session
4. Repeat at each session throughout the series

### Series Attendance Tracking

Check-in data for series pass holders lets you:

- See who attended which sessions
- Identify attendees with perfect attendance
- Notice patterns (e.g., lower attendance on certain dates)
- Follow up with pass holders who miss multiple sessions

## Viewing Attendance History

After an event concludes, you can review attendance:

### Single Event History

1. Go to the event page
2. Click **Manage Event** > **Attendance**
3. View the list showing:
   - All registered attendees
   - Check-in status (checked in, no-show, or pending)
   - Check-in timestamps for those who attended

### Series Attendance History

1. Go to **Manage Series**

2. Check if they have an active registration
3. Manually add them if they paid outside the system

### Can't Check Someone In
