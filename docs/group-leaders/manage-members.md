# Manage Members

As a group leader, you're responsible for managing who can join your group and what they can do. This guide covers approving members, assigning roles, and handling membership issues.

## Access Member Management

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Members** or **Manage Members** in the group menu
3. View your current members and pending requests

## Approve Join Requests

For private groups, you'll need to approve members before they can join.

### View Pending Requests

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Member Requests** or look for the notification badge
3. See all pending join requests

### Review a Request

Each request shows:
- Applicant's name and profile
- Date of request
- Answers to membership questions (if configured)

### Approve or Decline

For each request:

1. Review the applicant's information
2. Read their answers to membership questions
3. Click **Approve** to accept them as a member
4. Or click **Decline** to reject the request

:::tip Declining Requests
If you decline a request, consider sending a message explaining why. This helps applicants understand and potentially reapply if they address the issue.
