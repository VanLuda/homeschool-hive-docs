# Delete a Group

When you need to close your group, Homeschool Hive makes the process safe and transparent. This guide covers scheduling deletion, the 14-day grace period, data export, and what happens to your members and their payments.

:::warning Important
Group deletion is permanent after the 14-day grace period. Make sure to export all data you need before the deletion is complete.
:::

## Understanding Group Deletion

### The 14-Day Grace Period

When you schedule your group for deletion:
- Your group remains visible and functional for 14 days
- A countdown banner shows members how much time remains
- You can cancel the deletion at any time during this period
- All automatic processes happen at the end of the 14 days

This grace period gives you time to:
- Change your mind if circumstances change
- Export your group's data
- Communicate with members
- Handle any final administrative tasks

### What Happens Automatically

Homeschool Hive handles several tasks automatically when deletion is complete:

**Subscriptions & Refunds**
- All active membership subscriptions are cancelled
- Members receive pro-rated refunds for unused time
- Payment processing stops immediately

**Events**
- All upcoming events are cancelled
- Event attendees receive full refunds for paid tickets
- Members are notified of cancellations

**Member Notifications**
- All members receive notification of the upcoming closure
- Countdown reminders are sent as deletion approaches
- Final confirmation when group is deleted

**Data**
- All group data is permanently removed after 14 days
- Export your data before deletion completes

## Schedule Group Deletion

### Access the Danger Zone

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Settings** in the group menu
3. Scroll to the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom
4. Click **Delete Group**

### Confirm Deletion

For security, you'll need to confirm your decision:

1. Enter your **password**

   - Members will be notified
   - Automatic refunds will process
   - Data can be exported

:::tip Take Your Time
You don't need to rush this decision. Use the 14-day grace period to ensure you've handled everything you need to before the group is permanently deleted.
:::

### Confirmation

After scheduling deletion:
- You'll see a countdown banner at the top of your group
- Members see the same countdown banner
