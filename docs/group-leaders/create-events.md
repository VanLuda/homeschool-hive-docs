# Create Events

Events are at the heart of your homeschool group. This guide walks you through creating events, from simple free activities to complex paid events with multiple ticket types.

:::tip Recurring Events with Event Series
For recurring events like weekly classes, monthly workshops, or ongoing programs, use [Event Series](/docs/group-leaders/event-series) to create multiple sessions at once. Series passes let families purchase all sessions together at a discounted rate.
:::

## Start Creating an Event

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Create Event**
3. Follow the event creation wizard

## Basic Event Information

### Event Title

Choose a clear, descriptive title:
- "Fall Nature Walk at Smith Park"
- "Weekly Art Class - Session 3"
- "Zoo Field Trip"

### Date and Time

Set when your event takes place:

1. **Start Date** - When the event begins
2. **Start Time** - What time it starts
3. **End Time** - When the event ends (optional)
4. **Duration** - How long the event lasts

:::tip Multi-Day Events
For events spanning multiple days, create separate events for each day or use the description to explain the full schedule.
:::

### Event Type

Choose how attendees will participate:

**In-Person Event**
- Set a physical location
- Address appears on the event page
- Map shows the meeting point

**Virtual Event**
- Add a meeting URL (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- Link is shared with registered attendees
- No physical location needed

**Hybrid Event**
- Both in-person and virtual attendance options
- Set both location and virtual meeting details

### Location (In-Person Events)

1. Start typing the address
2. Select from autocomplete suggestions
3. Adjust the map pin if needed

## Event Description

Write a detailed description that covers:

- What will happen at the event
- What attendees should bring
- What to expect
- Any prerequisites or requirements
- Age recommendations

Use formatting to make it easy to read:
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for important information
- Clear paragraphs for different topics

## Event Image

Upload an image for your event:

- Recommended size: 1200 x 630 pixels
- Formats: JPG, PNG

A good image helps your event stand out and gives attendees a preview of what to expect.

## Categories

Select categories that describe your event:

- Field trips

- Arts and music
- STEM activities

Categories help members find relevant events.

For limited capacity events:

1. Toggle **Enable Waitlist** on
2. When the event fills, additional RSVPs join the waitlist
3. If someone cancels, the next person on the waitlist is notified
4. They can claim the spot and complete registration

## Registration Settings

### Registration Deadline

Set when registration closes:

- **No deadline** - Registration open until event starts
- **Custom deadline** - Set a specific date/time
- Usually 24-48 hours before the event

3. Parents can choose scholarship payment at checkout

See [Scholarship Invoices](/docs/group-leaders/scholarship-invoices) for more details.

## Event Terms

Require attendees to accept custom terms and conditions before registering for your event. This is useful for liability waivers, codes of conduct, photo release agreements, and other acknowledgments.

### When to Use Event Terms

Consider adding event terms for:

- **Physical activities** - Waivers for field trips, sports, climbing, swimming
- **Photo releases** - Permission to photograph children at events
- **Behavioral expectations** - Code of conduct for overnight trips or intensive programs
- **Allergy acknowledgments** - Confirmation that parents have reviewed allergy policies
- **Equipment responsibilities** - Agreement to care for borrowed materials

### Configuring Event Terms

1. Find the **Terms & Acknowledgments** card in the event creation form
2. Toggle **Require Terms Acceptance** on
3. Add individual term items that attendees must accept

### Adding Term Items

Each term item is a statement attendees must acknowledge:

1. Click **Add Item**
2. Enter the term text (e.g., "I agree to the liability waiver and release")
3. Toggle **Required** on/off
4. Add more items as needed

**Required vs Optional:**
- **Required terms** - Attendees must check these to proceed (marked with *)
- **Optional terms** - Attendees can skip these checkboxes

### Using Templates

Save time by loading terms from templates you've created:

1. Click **Load from Template**
2. Select a template from the dropdown
3. The template items are copied to your event
4. Customize as needed for this specific event

To create templates, go to your group settings and find **Terms Templates** in the sidebar.

### Dynamic Variables

Personalize your terms with variables that auto-fill event details:

| Variable | Replaced With |
|----------|---------------|
| `{group_name}` | Your group's name |
| `{event_name}` | This event's title |
| `{event_date}` | The event date |
| `{organizer_name}` | Event organizer's name |

**Example:**
```
I understand that {event_name} on {event_date} is organized by {group_name}.
```

Becomes:
```
I understand that Zoo Field Trip on Friday, March 15, 2025 is organized by Springfield Homeschoolers.
```

### How Terms Appear to Attendees

During checkout, attendees see your terms on the payment step:

1. Each term appears as a checkbox with your custom text
2. Required terms show a red asterisk (*)
3. Platform terms (Homeschool Hive's terms of service) also appear
4. Attendees must accept all required terms before completing registration

### Viewing Acceptance Records

After your event, you can see who accepted terms:

1. Go to your event page
2. Click **Manage Event**
3. Select the **Terms Acceptances** tab
4. View a list of all attendees and their acceptance timestamps

:::note Platform Terms
