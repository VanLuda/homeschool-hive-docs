# Create Events

Events are at the heart of your homeschool group. This guide walks you through creating events, from simple free activities to complex paid events with multiple ticket types.

## Start Creating an Event

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Create Event**
3. Follow the event creation wizard

## Basic Event Information

### Event Title

Choose a clear, descriptive title:
- "Fall Nature Walk at Smith Park"
- "Weekly Art Class - Session 3"
- "Zoo Field Trip"

### Date and Time

Set when your event takes place:

1. **Start Date** - When the event begins
2. **Start Time** - What time it starts
3. **End Time** - When the event ends (optional)
4. **Duration** - How long the event lasts

:::tip Multi-Day Events
For events spanning multiple days, create separate events for each day or use the description to explain the full schedule.
:::

### Event Type

Choose how attendees will participate:

**In-Person Event**
- Set a physical location
- Address appears on the event page
- Map shows the meeting point

**Virtual Event**
- Add a meeting URL (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- Link is shared with registered attendees
- No physical location needed

**Hybrid Event**

## Event Description

Write a detailed description that covers:

- What to expect
- Any prerequisites or requirements
- Age recommendations

Use formatting to make it easy to read:

- Bold for important information
- Clear paragraphs for different topics

## Event Image

Upload an image for your event:

- Recommended size: 1200 x 630 pixels

A good image helps your event stand out and gives attendees a preview of what to expect.

Categories help members find relevant events.
