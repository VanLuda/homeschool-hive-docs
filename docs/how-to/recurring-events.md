# How Do I Set Up Recurring Events for My Group?

Creating recurring events on Homeschool Hive saves you time by automatically generating multiple sessions for your weekly classes, monthly meetups, or ongoing activity series. Instead of manually creating each session, you can set up an entire semester's worth of events in just a few minutes.

## Quick Answer

To create a recurring event, navigate to **Create Event**, fill in your event details, then toggle on the **Event Series** option in the Series Configuration section. Choose your frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or daily), select the days of the week, specify the number of sessions, and optionally exclude specific dates like holidays.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Start Creating Your Event

1. Navigate to your group's page
2. Click the **Create Event** button
3. Fill in the basic event information:
   - Event title (e.g., "Wednesday Art Class")
   - Description
   - Location
   - Start date and time
   - End time

### Step 2: Enable Event Series

1. Scroll down to find the **Event Series** section
2. Toggle the switch to **On** - the card will highlight with a blue border indicating series mode is active
3. The series configuration options will expand below

### Step 3: Choose Your Frequency

Select how often your event repeats:

| Frequency | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Weekly** | Every week on selected days | Regular weekly classes |
| **Bi-weekly** | Every 2 weeks | Alternating week meetups |
| **Monthly** | Once per month | Monthly field trips or assemblies |
| **Daily** | Every day | Week-long camps or intensives |

### Step 4: Select Days of the Week (Weekly Events Only)

If you selected **Weekly** frequency, you'll see day-of-week buttons (S M T W T F S):

1. Click to select which days your event occurs
2. You can select multiple days (e.g., Monday and Wednesday for a twice-weekly class)
3. The first selected day should match your event's start date
4. At least one day must be selected

### Step 5: Set the Number of Sessions

1. Enter the total number of sessions for your series (2-52)
2. Use the quick preset buttons (4, 6, 8, or 12) for common series lengths
3. A typical semester might have 12-16 sessions
4. The system will generate sessions based on your frequency and days selected

### Step 6: Preview and Adjust Session Dates

The **Session Dates** preview shows all generated dates:

1. Review each session date, time, and session number
2. Click **Show all sessions** to see the complete list
3. The preview shows the day of the week and formatted date for each session

### Step 7: Exclude Specific Dates (Optional)

Need to skip holidays, breaks, or conflicts? Click the **X** button next to any session to exclude it:

1. Excluded dates appear crossed out with a red background
2. Session numbers automatically adjust to skip excluded dates
3. You can click again to re-include a date
4. A notice shows how many dates are excluded

:::tip Planning Around Breaks
Before creating your series, note down any holidays or school breaks. Common exclusions include:
- Thanksgiving week
- Winter break
- Spring break
- Memorial Day / Labor Day
:::

### Step 8: Configure Tickets and Pricing (Optional)

For paid event series, you have two pricing options:

1. **Per-Session Tickets**: Families pay for individual sessions they attend
2. **Series Pass**: Families pay once for access to all sessions in the series

To enable series passes:
1. Go to the Tickets & Pricing section
2. Create your ticket type
3. Enable the "Series Pass" option for that ticket
4. Set the series pass price (typically discounted from per-session total)

### Step 9: Create Your Event Series

1. Review all your settings
2. Click **Create Event**
3. The system generates all sessions at once
4. Each session is linked to the parent series event

## Managing Your Event Series

After creation, you can manage your series from the event page:

### Viewing Series Sessions

- The main event page shows the series overview
- Click **View All Sessions** to see the complete session list
- Each session shows its date, attendance status, and capacity

### Editing Individual Sessions

1. Navigate to the specific session you need to change
2. Click **Edit Session**
3. Changes to individual sessions do not affect other sessions in the series
4. You can change the time, location, or capacity for a single session

### Canceling Sessions

1. Open the session you need to cancel
2. Click **Cancel Session**
3. Registered attendees will be notified automatically
4. Paid registrations will be refunded based on your refund policy

### Duplicating a Series

Have a successful series you want to repeat next semester?

1. Go to your original series event
2. Click **Duplicate Series**
3. Update the start date for the new semester
4. Adjust any other details as needed
5. Create the new series

## Tips

:::tip Start Date Matters
The start date you enter determines when the first session occurs. Make sure it falls on one of your selected days of the week for weekly events.
:::

:::tip Session Numbering
Sessions are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3...) regardless of excluded dates. If you exclude session 3, the next session becomes session 3 and subsequent sessions renumber automatically.
:::

:::tip Capacity Planning
The capacity you set applies to each individual session, not the series total. If you set capacity to 15, each session can have up to 15 attendees.
:::

:::note Series Pass vs. Per-Session
Series passes encourage commitment and provide predictable attendance. Per-session tickets offer flexibility but may result in variable attendance. Consider your group's needs when choosing.

## Common Questions

**Can I change the frequency after creating a series?**
No, you'll need to delete the series and create a new one with the correct frequency.

**What happens if I need to add more sessions?**
You can create additional individual events or start a new series. Sessions cannot be added to an existing series.

**Can families register for just some sessions?**
Yes, if you offer per-session tickets. If you only offer series passes, families register for the entire series.

**How do I track attendance across a series?**
Each session has its own attendance tracking. You can view cumulative attendance reports from the series overview page.
