# How Do I Grow My Homeschool Group?

Growing your homeschool group takes intentional effort, but with the right strategies and tools, you can build a thriving community that attracts engaged families. Whether you are just starting out or looking to expand an established co-op, this guide will help you grow your homeschool group effectively using Homeschool Hive's features.

## Quick Answer

To grow your homeschool group, focus on three key areas: optimize your group's discoverability in Homeschool Hive's search, create engaging events that attract new families, and leverage announcements and social features to keep current members active and referring others. Consistent communication and quality programming are the foundation of sustainable growth.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Optimize Your Group Profile for Discovery

Your group profile is often the first impression potential members have. Make it count:

- **Write a compelling description** that clearly explains your group's mission, values, and what makes you unique
- **Choose relevant tags** so families searching for specific interests (nature study, STEM, classical education) can find you
- **Add a welcoming cover photo** that represents your group's personality
- **Specify your location accurately** to appear in local search results

### 2. Create Events That Attract New Families

Events are your best marketing tool. When families see exciting activities, they want to join:

- **Host open events** periodically that non-members can attend as guests
- **Offer variety** in your programming to appeal to different ages and interests
- **Plan signature events** that become associated with your group (annual science fair, monthly park days)
- **Use clear, descriptive event titles** that appear in search results

### 3. Leverage the Announcements Feature

Regular communication keeps your group top-of-mind and encourages word-of-mouth referrals:

- **Post weekly updates** highlighting upcoming events and group news
- **Celebrate member achievements** to build community pride
- **Share photos and recaps** from recent events (with permission) to show the value of membership
- **Welcome new members publicly** to make them feel included immediately

See [Announcements](/docs/group-leaders/announcements) for detailed guidance on effective group communications.

### 4. Encourage Member Referrals

Your current members are your best recruiters:

- **Ask satisfied members** to invite homeschooling friends
- **Create referral incentives** like discounted event tickets for successful referrals
- **Make joining easy** by keeping your approval process straightforward
- **Respond quickly** to membership requests so interested families do not lose momentum

### 5. Build an Active Online Presence

Use Homeschool Hive's social features to create community between events:

- **Post regularly** to your group's social feed
- **Encourage member interaction** by asking questions and sharing resources
- **Respond to comments** to show you are engaged and accessible
- **Share your group link** on your personal social media and local homeschool forums

### 6. Partner with Other Groups and Organizations

Collaboration expands your reach:

- **Co-host events** with complementary groups to cross-promote
- **Connect with local libraries, museums, and nature centers** for field trip partnerships
- **Join local homeschool networks** and participate in community events
- **Attend homeschool conventions** and connect with families in your area

### 7. Maintain Quality as You Grow

Sustainable growth requires maintaining what made your group attractive:

- **Delegate responsibilities** by promoting trusted members to co-leader or event manager roles
- **Gather feedback regularly** through informal conversations or simple polls
- **Stay true to your mission** while remaining open to new ideas
- **Address issues promptly** to maintain a positive group culture

## Tips

:::tip Start Small and Consistent
You do not need to implement everything at once. Pick two or three strategies and execute them consistently. A steady drumbeat of quality events and regular communication will grow your group faster than sporadic big pushes.
:::

:::tip Track What Works
Pay attention to which events attract the most new members and what types of announcements get the most engagement. Double down on what resonates with your community.
:::

:::tip Quality Over Quantity
A smaller, engaged group often provides more value than a large, disconnected one. Focus on attracting families who align with your group's values and will actively participate.
:::

:::note Patience Pays Off
Building a thriving homeschool community takes time. Most successful groups grew steadily over one to two years of consistent effort. Celebrate small wins along the way.

## Measuring Your Growth

Track these metrics to understand your progress:

- **Membership requests per month**: Are more families finding you?
- **Event attendance rates**: Are members staying engaged?
- **Member retention**: Are families renewing their memberships?
- **Referral sources**: Ask new members how they heard about you
