# How Do I Manage Multiple Children's Registrations?

Homeschool families often have multiple children participating in activities together. Homeschool Hive makes it easy to add all your children to your family profile, then quickly register them for events without re-entering their information every time. You can also track allergies, special needs, and emergency contacts for each child.

## Quick Answer

Go to **Account** > **Family Members** to add your children's profiles with their information, allergies, and emergency contacts. When registering for events, you'll see all your family members listed and can select which children to register with just a few clicks.

## Understanding Family Profiles

### Why Add Family Members?

Adding your children to your Homeschool Hive account provides several benefits:

- **Faster registration**: Select children from a list instead of typing names each time
- **Safety information**: Allergies and medical needs are shared with event organizers
- **Emergency preparedness**: Emergency contact information travels with each child's registration
- **Accurate attendance**: Event organizers know exactly who to expect
- **Age-appropriate events**: Organizers can see children's ages for planning purposes

### What Information is Stored?

For each family member, you can add:

- **Basic info**: Name, date of birth, gender, relationship to you
- **Medical info**: Allergies (with severity), special needs, medical conditions
- **Emergency contacts**: Name, phone, and relationship of emergency contact
- **Accommodations**: Any special accommodations needed at events

**Can two parents share a family profile?**
Currently, each parent has their own account with their own family members. Both parents can add the same children to their respective accounts.

**What if my child has no allergies?**
You don't need to add any allergy information. Leave those sections empty.

**Can I register an adult family member?**
Yes, you can add adults as family members using the "Spouse" or "Other" relationship type.

**Do I need to add children for free events?**
For accurate headcounts and safety, yes. Even free events benefit from knowing who's attending.

**What happens to medical info when I cancel?**
Medical information remains in your family profile. It's only shared with organizers when you register for events.
