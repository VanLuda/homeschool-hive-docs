# How Do I Export My Calendar to Google or Apple?

Keep all your homeschool events in sync with your favorite calendar app. Homeschool Hive provides a calendar subscription link that automatically updates your Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, or any other calendar app whenever you RSVP to new events or your schedule changes.

## Quick Answer

Go to **My Events** > **Calendar**, then click the **Subscribe** button to get your personal calendar subscription URL. Copy this URL and add it to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook as a "subscription" or "from URL" calendar. Your events will automatically sync and stay updated.

## Understanding Calendar Sync

### How Calendar Subscriptions Work

Unlike a one-time export, a calendar subscription creates a live connection:

1. **You subscribe once** - Add the URL to your calendar app
2. **Events sync automatically** - New RSVPs appear, cancellations disappear
3. **Updates happen regularly** - Most apps check for updates every 15-60 minutes
4. **It's read-only** - Changes must be made in Homeschool Hive, not your calendar app

### What Gets Synced

Your calendar subscription includes:

- All events you've RSVP'd "Going" to
- Event series sessions you're registered for
- Event name, date, time, and duration
- Location information
- Event description and group name
- Link back to the event on Homeschool Hive

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Calendar Subscription URL

1. Log in to Homeschool Hive
2. Navigate to **My Events** in the main navigation
3. Click **Calendar** to view your calendar
4. Look for the **Subscribe** or **Sync Calendar** button
5. Click to reveal your personal subscription URL
6. Click **Copy** to copy the URL to your clipboard

:::warning Keep Your URL Private
Your calendar URL is personal and unique to your account. Anyone with this URL can see your event schedule. Don't share it publicly.

## Tips

:::tip Event Series Display
Events from a series show the session number in the title (e.g., "Art Class (3/12)") so you always know which session it is.
:::

:::tip Multiple Calendar Apps
You can add your subscription URL to multiple calendar apps simultaneously. They'll all receive the same updates.
:::

:::tip Sync Timing
Changes in Homeschool Hive may take 15 minutes to several hours to appear in your calendar app, depending on the app's refresh settings.
:::

:::note Calendar is Read-Only
You cannot add, edit, or delete Homeschool Hive events from your calendar app. All changes must be made on Homeschool Hive directly.
:::

## Troubleshooting

**Events not appearing?**
- Wait 15-60 minutes for initial sync
- Verify the URL was copied completely
- Check that the calendar is enabled/visible in your app
- Try removing and re-adding the subscription

**Wrong times showing?**
- Verify your calendar app's timezone settings
- Ensure your Homeschool Hive account timezone is correct
- Check if daylight saving time might be affecting display

**Duplicate events?**
- You may have multiple subscriptions to the same URL
- Remove duplicate calendar subscriptions
- Check if you've also manually added events

**Events missing after cancellation?**
- Canceled RSVPs are automatically removed
- Wait for your calendar app to refresh
- This is expected behavior - only confirmed events appear
