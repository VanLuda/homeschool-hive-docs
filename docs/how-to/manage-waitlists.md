# How Do I Handle Waitlists for Popular Events?

When your events fill up fast, you need a fair way to handle overflow interest. Homeschool Hive uses a Watchlist system that notifies interested families when spots become available. This guide explains how to manage capacity and keep your community engaged even when events are full.

## Quick Answer

Homeschool Hive uses a Watchlist (Favorites) system instead of a traditional waitlist. When an event is full, interested families can add it to their Watchlist. If a spot opens up (someone cancels), all Watchlist members receive a notification and can register on a first-come, first-served basis. This creates a fair, transparent system for popular events.

## Understanding the Watchlist System

### How It Works

1. **Event fills up** - All available spots are taken
2. **Families add to Watchlist** - Interested members click the heart/favorite icon
3. **Spot opens** - When someone cancels their registration
4. **All Watchlist members notified** - Everyone watching the event gets an alert
5. **First to register gets the spot** - Members register normally when they receive the notification

### Watchlist vs. Traditional Waitlist

| Feature | Watchlist (Homeschool Hive) | Traditional Waitlist |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Notification | All interested parties notified equally | Only next person in line |
| Fairness | First to respond gets the spot | Based on sign-up order |
| Transparency | Members know they are competing fairly | Uncertain position |
| Automatic promotion | No (members must act) | Often automatic |
| Member engagement | Members stay informed | Members wait passively |

:::note
The Watchlist system was designed to be more transparent and fair than traditional first-in-first-out waitlists. All interested families have an equal opportunity to claim available spots.

## For Group Leaders

### Setting Up Event Capacity

When creating an event, you can control capacity to ensure the Watchlist system works effectively.

#### Step 1: Set Maximum Capacity

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Create Event** or edit an existing event
3. Find the **Capacity** section
4. Enter the **Maximum Attendees** for your event
5. Consider your venue size, adult-to-child ratios, and activity requirements

#### Step 2: Consider Per-Family Limits

For high-demand events:
1. Set a **per-family limit** on the number of spots one family can reserve
2. This prevents one large family from taking most available spots
3. Typical limits range from 2-6 depending on the event type

### Monitoring Event Capacity

To see how your event is filling up:

1. Go to your group's **Events** page
2. Click on the event you want to monitor
3. View the **Attendance** section showing:
   - Current registrations
   - Remaining spots
   - Number of families watching (Watchlist count)

### When Someone Cancels

When a registered family cancels:

1. **Automatic notification** - The system sends "Spots Available" notifications to all Watchlist members
2. **Email and in-app** - Notifications go through both channels based on member preferences
3. **No action required** - You do not need to manually notify anyone

### Manually Managing Registrations

If you need to add someone who missed the notification:

1. Go to the event's **Attendees** list
2. Click **Add Attendee**
3. Search for the member
4. Confirm their registration

:::tip
If you frequently have more demand than capacity, consider running the event multiple times or finding a larger venue.

## For Parents

### Adding Events to Your Watchlist

When an event you want is full:

1. Go to the event page
2. Click the **heart icon** (Favorite/Watch)
3. The event is now on your Watchlist

### Managing Your Watchlist

To view all events you are watching:

1. Click **Watchlist** in the main navigation
2. See all favorited events, including:
   - Events you are interested in
   - Sold-out events you are watching
   - Upcoming events you have saved

### Getting Notified About Open Spots

When a spot opens on a watched event:

1. **Check notifications** - Look for the "Spots Available" notification
2. **Act quickly** - Other families received the same notification
3. **Register normally** - Click through to the event and complete registration

### Setting Up Notification Preferences

To ensure you receive Watchlist notifications:

1. Go to **Account** > **Notification Preferences**
2. Find the **Events** section
3. Enable **Spots Available** notifications
4. Choose your preferred channels (email, push, in-app)

:::warning
If you disable "Spots Available" notifications, you will not be alerted when spots open on events you are watching.

## Strategies for Popular Events

### For Group Leaders

**Prevent overwhelming demand:**
- Open registration at a specific time and announce it in advance
- Consider a "members-only" registration window before opening to the public
- Run the same event multiple times if demand is consistently high

**Manage expectations:**
- Clearly state the capacity limit in the event description
- Let families know about the Watchlist system
- Communicate realistic chances of spots opening up

**Handle special cases:**
- You can manually add members if warranted
- Consider reserving a few spots for last-minute additions
- Be transparent about any exceptions you make

### For Parents

**Increase your chances:**
- Register as soon as registration opens
- Add sold-out events to your Watchlist immediately
- Enable push notifications for fastest alerts
- Check notifications regularly during high-demand periods

**Be prepared:**
- Have payment information saved for quick checkout
- Know your availability before the event date
- Be ready to respond quickly when notified

## Tips

- **Enable push notifications** - These arrive faster than email for time-sensitive openings
- **Check event capacity early** - Register before events fill up
- **Save payment methods** - Faster checkout means better chances of securing a spot
- **Be patient** - Popular events often have cancellations as the date approaches
- **Consider all times** - Less popular time slots may have availability

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why does not Homeschool Hive use a traditional waitlist?**
The Watchlist system is fairer because everyone has an equal chance to claim available spots, rather than being locked into a queue position.

**How quickly should I respond to a "Spots Available" notification?**
As quickly as possible. Other families received the same notification and spots are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

**Can I see how many people are on the Watchlist for an event?**
Group leaders can see Watchlist counts. Regular members can see if they have added an event to their Watchlist.

**What if I miss the notification?**
You can still try to register. If spots remain, you will be able to complete registration.

**Can the group leader manually add me to a full event?**
Yes, group leaders have the ability to add attendees even when an event is at capacity. Contact your group leader for special circumstances.
