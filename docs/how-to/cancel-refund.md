# How Do I Cancel or Get a Refund for an Event?

Life happens, and sometimes you need to cancel your plans. This guide explains how to cancel your event registration on Homeschool Hive and understand when you may be eligible for a refund.

## Quick Answer

To cancel an event registration, go to the event page and click "Cancel RSVP." For paid events, refund eligibility depends on how far in advance you cancel and the group's refund policy. Most groups offer full refunds when you cancel at least 24 hours before the event starts.

## Understanding Refund Policies

Before canceling, it helps to understand how refund policies work on Homeschool Hive.

### How Refund Eligibility Is Determined

Refund amounts are calculated based on:

1. **Time until the event** - How many hours remain before the event starts
2. **The group's refund policy** - Each group can set their own cutoff times and refund percentages
3. **Platform default policy** - If no group policy exists, the platform default applies

### Common Refund Scenarios

| Time Before Event | Typical Refund |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 24+ hours | Full refund (100%) |
| 12-24 hours | Partial refund (50-75%) |
| Less than 12 hours | No refund or small percentage |
| After event starts | No refund |

:::note
Each group sets their own refund policy. Check the event details or contact the group leader if you are unsure about the specific policy.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Event

1. Log in to your Homeschool Hive account
2. Go to **My Events** from the main menu, or find the event in your **Calendar**
3. Click on the event you want to cancel

### Step 2: View Your Registration

On the event page, you will see your current registration status showing "Going" or "Registered."

### Step 3: Cancel Your RSVP

1. Click the **Cancel RSVP** button on the event page
2. A confirmation dialog will appear showing:
   - Your current registration details
   - The number of spots you are canceling
   - For paid events: your refund eligibility and amount

### Step 4: Confirm the Cancellation

1. Review the cancellation details carefully
2. If you have paid for the event, note the refund amount shown
3. Click **Confirm Cancellation** to proceed

### Step 5: Receive Confirmation

After canceling:
- You will see a confirmation message on screen
- An email confirmation is sent to your registered email address
- For paid events, refund processing information is included

## Refund Processing

### For Eligible Refunds

When you cancel and qualify for a refund:

1. **Automatic processing** - Eligible refunds are processed automatically
2. **Same payment method** - Refunds return to the original payment method
3. **Processing time** - Allow 5-10 business days for the refund to appear on your statement

### What Gets Refunded

For paid events, your refund may include:
- **Event ticket price** - The base price you paid
- **Processing fees** - Depending on the group's policy, some fees may be non-refundable

:::tip
If you need to cancel but the automatic refund window has passed, contact the group leader directly. Many leaders will work with you on a case-by-case basis.

## Special Situations

### Event Cancellation by the Organizer

If the group leader cancels the event:
- All attendees receive automatic full refunds
- You will be notified via email
- No action is required on your part

### Modifying Your Registration

Instead of canceling entirely, you may be able to modify your registration:

1. **Reduce spots** - If you registered multiple family members, you can reduce the number
2. **Change attendees** - Some events allow swapping who is attending
3. **Transfer to another family** - Contact the group leader about transferring your spot

### Past the Refund Cutoff

If you are past the refund deadline:

1. Contact the group leader through the group's messaging
2. Explain your situation
3. Leaders have the ability to issue manual refunds at their discretion

## Checking Refund Status

To check the status of a pending refund:

1. Go to **Account** > **Payment History**
2. Find the original payment for the event
3. Look for a "Refund" status or pending refund notation
4. Check your email for refund confirmation

## Tips

- **Cancel early** - The sooner you cancel, the better your refund eligibility
- **Check the policy first** - Review the event's refund policy before registering for paid events
- **Use the Watchlist** - Add events to your Watchlist before committing if you are unsure about attendance
- **Communicate with leaders** - Group leaders can often help with special circumstances
- **Keep confirmation emails** - Save your registration and cancellation confirmation emails for your records

:::warning
Refunds cannot be issued for no-shows. Always cancel your registration if you cannot attend, even for free events. This helps the group leader manage capacity and may allow someone on the Watchlist to attend.
