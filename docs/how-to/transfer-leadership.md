# How Do I Transfer Group Leadership?

Whether you are stepping down, moving away, or simply want to share responsibilities, transferring group leadership on Homeschool Hive is straightforward. This guide covers everything from adding Co-Leaders to fully transferring ownership.

## Quick Answer

To transfer group ownership, go to your group's Settings, select "Transfer Ownership," choose the new owner from your members list, and confirm by typing "TRANSFER." The new owner gains full control, and you become a Co-Leader. This action cannot be undone without the new owner's cooperation.

## Understanding Group Leadership Roles

Before transferring leadership, understand the different roles available:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control including deletion, ownership transfer, Stripe settings |
| **Co-Leader** | Most admin functions except ownership transfer and deletion |
| **Event Manager** | Create and manage events only |
| **Member** | Standard participation |

:::note
Each group can only have one Owner, but can have multiple Co-Leaders and Event Managers.
:::

## Option 1: Add Co-Leaders (Share Responsibilities)

If you want to share leadership duties without giving up ownership, add Co-Leaders.

### Step-by-Step: Adding a Co-Leader

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Select **Members** or **Membership**
4. Find the member you want to promote
5. Click the **three-dot menu** next to their name
6. Select **Change Role**
7. Choose **Co-Leader** from the dropdown
8. Click **Save**

### What Co-Leaders Can Do

- Create, edit, and cancel events
- Approve or deny membership requests
- Manage member roles (except Owner)
- Send announcements
- View payment and attendance reports
- Manage group settings (except ownership and Stripe)

### What Co-Leaders Cannot Do

- Transfer group ownership
- Delete the group
- Modify Stripe Connect settings
- Remove the Owner

## Option 2: Transfer Full Ownership

When you need to completely hand over the group to someone else.

### Before You Transfer

:::warning
Ownership transfer cannot be undone by you. Only the new owner can transfer ownership back. Make sure you are ready to give up control.
:::

Consider these factors:
- The new owner will have complete control
- You will become a Co-Leader after transfer
- Stripe payment settings remain unchanged
- All members and events stay intact

### Step-by-Step: Transferring Ownership

1. **Navigate to Group Settings**
   - Go to your group page
   - Click the **Settings** gear icon
   - Select **General** settings

2. **Find Transfer Option**
   - Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
   - Click **Transfer Ownership**

3. **Select New Owner**
   - A modal will appear with a searchable list of members
   - Search for and select the member who will become the new owner
   - Review their current role

4. **Review the Changes**
   - The modal will show what happens:
     - Selected member becomes the new Owner
     - You become a Co-Leader
     - Stripe payments continue normally

5. **Confirm the Transfer**
   - Type "TRANSFER" in the confirmation field (must be in capitals)
   - Click **Transfer Ownership**

6. **Confirmation**
   - You will see a success message
   - The page will refresh to reflect your new Co-Leader role

### What Happens to Payments

When you transfer ownership:
- The group's Stripe Connect account remains attached to the group
- Payment processing continues without interruption
- The original Stripe account owner retains access to their Stripe dashboard
- The new group owner can view payment reports in Homeschool Hive

:::tip
If the Stripe account needs to change (for example, payments should go to the new owner's bank account), the new owner should set up their own Stripe Connect account in group settings after the transfer.
:::

## Option 3: Add Event Managers

For groups where you want help with events but not full admin access.

### Step-by-Step: Adding an Event Manager

1. Go to your group's **Members** page
2. Find the member you want to make an Event Manager
3. Click the **three-dot menu** next to their name
4. Select **Change Role**
5. Choose **Event Manager**
6. Click **Save**

### Event Manager Capabilities

Event Managers can:
- Create new events
- Edit events they created
- Manage RSVPs for their events
- View attendance for their events

Event Managers cannot:
- Edit events created by others
- Manage group membership
- Access payment settings
- Change group settings

## Planning a Leadership Transition

For a smooth transition, follow these best practices:

### 1. Communicate with Your Group

Before making changes:
- Announce the upcoming transition to members
- Introduce the new leader(s)
- Explain any changes to expect

### 2. Document Important Information

Share with the new leader:
- Regular meeting schedules and locations
- Vendor contacts for field trips
- Recurring event templates
- Membership policies and pricing decisions
- Any outstanding issues or pending requests

### 3. Train the New Leader

Walk them through:
- Creating and managing events
- Approving membership requests
- Using the announcement feature
- Accessing payment reports
- Managing member roles

### 4. Execute the Transfer

- Add them as Co-Leader first to let them practice
- When ready, complete the ownership transfer
- Remain as Co-Leader during the transition period
- Step back gradually as they gain confidence

## Tips

- **Start with Co-Leader** - Before full transfer, add the person as a Co-Leader so they can learn the system
- **Time it right** - Avoid transferring during busy registration periods
- **Keep communication open** - Stay available to answer questions during the transition
- **Update your contact info** - Make sure the new leader's contact information is visible to members
- **Review connected accounts** - Remind the new owner to review Stripe settings if needed

## Troubleshooting

**I transferred ownership by accident**
Contact the new owner immediately and ask them to transfer it back. Only they can do this.

**The member I want is not showing in the list**
They must be an active member of the group. Check if their membership is pending approval.

**I want to leave the group completely after transfer**
After transferring ownership, you can leave the group like any other member. Go to your membership settings and select "Leave Group."

**The new owner has not received any notification**
The new owner should refresh their browser. They will see their new Owner role reflected in the group settings.
