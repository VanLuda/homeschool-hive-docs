# How Do I Set Up Membership Tiers for My Group?

Collecting membership dues helps sustain your homeschool group and fund activities. Homeschool Hive lets you set up free or paid memberships with flexible billing options, trial periods, and grace periods for late payments. All payments are processed securely through Stripe, and you keep 100% of the membership fees collected.

## Quick Answer

Go to your **Group Settings** > **Payments & Billing**, connect your Stripe account if you haven't already, then configure your membership as free or paid. For paid memberships, set your price, choose monthly or annual billing, and optionally add trial and grace periods. Members will be automatically billed on their renewal dates.

## Understanding Membership Options

### Free vs. Paid Memberships

| Feature | Free Membership | Paid Membership |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Join process | Instant or approval | Approval + payment |
| Recurring billing | No | Monthly or annual |
| Trial period | N/A | Optional |
| Grace period | N/A | Configurable |
| Access to events | Full access | Full access |
| Revenue | None | Your group keeps 100% |

### Who Can Set Up Memberships?

Only **Group Owners** and **Co-Leaders** can configure membership settings. Additionally, your group must be set to **Private** to enable paid memberships (public groups cannot charge fees).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Part 1: Connect Stripe (Required for Paid Memberships)

Before setting up paid memberships, you need a connected Stripe account.

#### Step 1: Access Payment Settings

1. Go to your group's page
2. Click **Settings** in the group navigation
3. Select **Payments & Billing**

#### Step 2: Connect Your Stripe Account

If you haven't connected Stripe yet:

1. Click **Connect Stripe Account**
2. You'll be redirected to Stripe's secure onboarding
3. Enter your business or personal information
4. Add your bank account for payouts
5. Complete identity verification
6. Return to Homeschool Hive

Stripe onboarding typically takes 2-5 minutes. Have your bank account information and ID ready for fastest setup.

#### Step 3: Verify Connection

After returning from Stripe:

1. Your status should show **Payments Active** with a green checkmark
2. If it shows "Pending," click **Check Status** to refresh
3. If issues arise, you may need to complete additional verification

### Part 2: Configure Membership Settings

Once Stripe is connected, you can set up your membership model.

#### Step 1: Choose Membership Type

In the **Membership Configuration** section:

1. You'll see two options displayed as cards:

## Tips

:::tip Pricing Strategy
Research what similar groups in your area charge. Consider your costs: insurance, venue rental, supplies, and administrative time. Price to sustain your group long-term.
:::

:::tip Annual Incentive
If you offer both monthly and annual options, consider offering a discount for annual payment (e.g., 10 months for the price of 12) to encourage longer commitments.
:::

:::tip Trial Period Benefits
A trial period lets families experience your group before committing financially. This can increase conversion rates and reduce early cancellations.
:::

If you change membership prices, existing members keep their current rate until they cancel and rejoin. Only new members pay the new price.

Set your price as a "family membership" and communicate that it covers all family members in that household.

**What if I need to refund a membership?**
Process refunds through your Stripe dashboard. Homeschool Hive will update the member's status accordingly.

Yes, filter your members list by status to see those in grace period or with expired memberships.
