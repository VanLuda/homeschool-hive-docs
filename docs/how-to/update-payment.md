# How Do I Update My Payment Method?

Keeping your payment information up to date ensures seamless registration for paid events and group memberships. This guide shows you how to add, update, and remove payment methods on Homeschool Hive.

## Quick Answer

To update your payment method, go to **Account** > **Payment Methods**. From there, you can add a new card by clicking "Add Payment Method," or remove an existing card by clicking the trash icon. Your saved payment methods work across all groups on the platform through Stripe's secure payment system.

   - Click **Add Payment Method**

- **Shared accounts** - Different family members can use different cards

### Choosing a Card at Checkout

When you register for a paid event:

1. The checkout page shows your saved payment methods
2. Select the card you want to use
3. Or choose "Use a different card" to enter new details
4. Complete your registration

### Setting a Default Card

Currently, the most recently used card is typically suggested at checkout. You can always select a different card during the payment process.

## Subscription Payment Updates

If you have recurring memberships or subscriptions:

### Updating Payment for a Specific Subscription

1. Go to **Account** > **Subscriptions**
2. Find the subscription you want to update
3. Click **Manage** or the three-dot menu
4. Select **Update Payment Method**
5. Choose from your saved cards or add a new one
6. Confirm the change

### What Happens When a Payment Fails

If a subscription payment fails:

1. You receive an email notification
2. The system retries the payment after a few days
3. Update your payment method to ensure the next attempt succeeds
4. If payments continue to fail, your membership may be suspended

## Security and Privacy

### How Your Data Is Protected
