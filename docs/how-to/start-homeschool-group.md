# How Do I Start a Homeschool Group?

Starting a homeschool group or co-op is a rewarding way to build community, share resources, and provide enriching experiences for homeschooling families. Homeschool Hive provides all the tools you need to create, organize, and manage your group from day one.

## Quick Answer

To start a homeschool group, click **Groups** in the navigation, then select **Create Group**. Follow the multi-step wizard to set your group name, location, privacy settings, membership options, and payment configuration. Your group can be live and accepting members within minutes.

## Before You Begin

Take time to consider these foundational questions:

**What is your group's purpose?**
- Academic co-op with classes and curriculum
- Field trip coordination group
- Social connection for homeschool families
- Special interest group (arts, STEM, sports)
- Support network for homeschool parents

**Who is your target audience?**
- Specific age ranges
- Particular educational philosophy
- Geographic area
- Faith-based or secular community

**What commitment level will you require?**
- Casual participation vs. regular attendance
- Free access vs. paid membership
- Open enrollment vs. application process

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Start the Group Creation Process

1. Log in to your Homeschool Hive account
2. Click **Groups** in the main navigation
3. Click the **Create Group** button
4. The group creation wizard opens

### Step 2: Set Basic Information

**Group Name:**
Choose a clear, descriptive name that helps families understand your focus.

Good examples:
- "Westside Homeschool Co-op"
- "Nature Explorers Field Trip Group"
- "Classical Conversations - Springfield"

**Group Type:**
- **Local Group** - Your group meets at physical locations
- **Online Group** - Your group operates virtually without in-person meetings

**Location (for local groups):**
1. Start typing your city or address
2. Select from the autocomplete suggestions
3. Adjust the map pin if needed

This helps families find your group when searching by location.

### Step 3: Configure Privacy Settings

Choose who can see and join your group:

**Public Group:**
- Appears in search results
- All group details visible to everyone
- Members can join directly (free) or through checkout (paid)
- Best for: Open communities welcoming all families

**Private Group:**
- Appears in search results with limited details
- Members must request to join and be approved
- You can add custom membership questions
- Best for: Groups requiring vetting or specific commitment levels

**Hidden Group (Private only):**
- Does not appear in search results
- Members join only via direct invite link
- Best for: Exclusive groups or invitation-only communities

### Step 4: Set Membership Options

**Free Membership:**
- No cost for families to join
- Best for casual groups or volunteer-run co-ops
- Members join instantly (public) or after approval (private)

**Paid Membership:**
Configure pricing for your group:

1. Set your membership fee amount
2. Choose a billing cycle:
   - **Monthly** - Recurring payment each month
   - **Annual** - One payment per year (often a better value)
3. Optionally set grace periods for payment lapses

:::tip Pricing Strategy
Annual memberships provide more predictable income and reduce administrative overhead. Consider offering a discount for annual vs. monthly payments to encourage longer commitments.

### Step 5: Add Membership Questions (Optional)

For private groups, create questions applicants must answer:

1. Click **Add Question**
2. Enter your question text
3. Mark as required or optional
4. Add additional questions as needed

**Example questions:**
- "What ages are your children?"
- "How did you hear about our group?"
- "What are you hoping to gain from membership?"
- "Can you commit to attending at least 2 events per month?"
- "Do you agree to our group's code of conduct?"

These questions help you evaluate applicants before approving membership.

### Step 6: Write Your Group Description

Create a compelling description that covers:

- Your group's mission and purpose
- Activities and events you offer
- Educational philosophy (if applicable)
- What families can expect as members
- Meeting frequency and typical schedule
- Any requirements or expectations

Use formatting to make it scannable:
- Bullet points for key information
- Bold text for important details
- Clear paragraphs for different topics

### Step 7: Select Categories

Choose categories that describe your group:

- Academic co-ops
- Field trip groups
- Sports and recreation
- Arts and music
- STEM activities
- Social groups
- Religious/faith-based
- Nature and outdoors

Categories help families discover your group when searching by interest.

### Step 8: Upload a Group Image

Add a photo that represents your group:

- Recommended size: 1200 x 630 pixels
- Formats: JPG or PNG
- Choose an image reflecting your activities or community
- Avoid images with identifiable children without permission

### Step 9: Set Up Payments (Paid Groups)

If you chose paid membership, connect a Stripe account:

1. Click **Connect with Stripe**
2. Follow the Stripe onboarding process
3. Provide business information and banking details
4. Complete verification

Your group remains in draft status until Stripe verification is complete. See [Stripe Setup](/docs/group-leaders/payments-stripe) for detailed instructions.

### Step 10: Review and Launch

1. Review all your settings on the summary page
2. Make any final adjustments
3. Click **Create Group**
4. Your group is now live!

## After Creating Your Group

### Invite Your First Members

Share your group with potential members:

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Invite Members** or copy the group link
3. Share via email, social media, or local homeschool networks

### Create Your First Event

Get activity started in your group:

1. Go to your group page
2. Click **Create Event**
3. Set up an inaugural event or regular meeting
4. Members will receive notifications

### Set Up Your Leadership Team

Delegate responsibilities to trusted members:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Roles**
2. Assign Co-Leader or Event Manager roles
3. Customize permissions as needed

## Tips

- **Start small** - Begin with a few events to gauge interest before committing to a complex schedule
- **Set clear expectations** - Document participation requirements, behavior guidelines, and communication preferences
- **Build a leadership team** - Recruit co-leaders early to share the administrative load
- **Communicate regularly** - Use the group feed for announcements and keep members informed
- **Gather feedback** - Ask members what activities they want and adjust your offerings
- **Be patient** - Building a thriving community takes time; start with a core group of committed families

:::note Payment Considerations
If you are collecting membership fees, consider whether to absorb platform fees or pass them to members. You can configure this in your group settings.
