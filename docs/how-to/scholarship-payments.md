# How Do I Accept Scholarship Payments for Events?

Many homeschool families use Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), scholarship programs, or other educational funding to pay for activities. Homeschool Hive makes it easy to accept these payments by generating professional invoices that families can submit to their scholarship providers.

## Quick Answer

To accept scholarship payments: Go to your **Group Settings** > **Scholarship Settings**, configure your organization information for invoices, then enable scholarship eligibility on individual events or tickets. When families choose scholarship payment at checkout, Homeschool Hive automatically generates a detailed invoice they can submit to their funding provider.

## Understanding Scholarship Payments

### How It Works

1. **Group Setup**: You configure your organization's details for invoice generation
2. **Event Setup**: You mark events or tickets as scholarship-eligible
3. **Family Checkout**: Families select "Pay with Scholarship" at checkout
4. **Invoice Generation**: The system creates a professional invoice with all required details
5. **Payment Tracking**: You track which invoices have been paid by scholarship providers

### Supported Funding Types

Homeschool Hive invoices are designed to work with:

- **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)** - Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, etc.
- **Scholarship Programs** - Private and state-funded scholarships
- **Educational Grants** - Foundation and nonprofit grants
- **529 Plan Distributions** - For qualifying educational expenses
- **Coverdell ESAs** - Education savings accounts

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Part 1: Configure Scholarship Settings

Before accepting scholarship payments, set up your organization's invoice information.

#### Step 1: Access Scholarship Settings

1. Go to your group's **Dashboard**
2. Click **Settings** in the navigation
3. Select **Scholarship** from the settings menu

#### Step 2: Add Organization Information

Fill in the details that will appear on generated invoices:

**Required Information:**
- **Organization Name**: Your group or co-op's official name
- **Address**: Street address, city, state, and ZIP code

**Recommended Information:**
- **EIN (Tax ID)**: Many scholarship providers require this
- **Phone Number**: For provider inquiries
- **Email Address**: Contact email for payment questions
- **Website**: Your group's website (if applicable)
- **Logo URL**: A link to your organization's logo for professional invoices

#### Step 3: Set Default Instructions

Add instructions that appear on all invoices:

```
Example instructions:
"Please submit this invoice to your scholarship provider within 30 days of the
event date. Include the invoice number in all correspondence. For questions
about this invoice, contact treasurer@yourhomeschoolgroup.com"
```

:::tip EIN Requirements
Many ESA and scholarship programs require a valid Employer Identification Number (EIN) to process payments. If your group doesn't have an EIN, consider:
- Applying for one through the IRS (free)
- Operating under a fiscal sponsor that has an EIN
- Checking if your state allows payments without an EIN
:::

#### Step 4: Save Your Settings

Click **Save Settings** to store your configuration. These settings apply to all scholarship invoices generated for your group.

### Part 2: Enable Scholarship Eligibility on Events

#### Method 1: Enable for Entire Event

1. Create or edit an event
2. In the **Event Settings** section, find **Scholarship Eligible**
3. Toggle the option to **On**
4. All tickets for this event will accept scholarship payments

#### Method 2: Enable for Specific Tickets

1. In your event's **Tickets & Pricing** section
2. Click to edit the specific ticket type
3. Enable **Scholarship Eligible** for that ticket
4. Only that ticket type will show scholarship payment option

:::note Mixed Payment Events
You can have some tickets that accept scholarships and others that don't. For example, a "Member" ticket might accept scholarships while an "Adult Chaperone" ticket requires regular payment.

## Common Questions

**What if a scholarship payment is denied?**
Contact the family to arrange alternative payment. You can update the payment method in their registration or cancel and refund their spot.

**Can families pay partially with scholarship?**
Yes, families can split payment between scholarship and card. At checkout, they specify the scholarship amount and pay the remainder with their saved payment method.

**How do I handle refunds for scholarship payments?**
If you haven't received the scholarship payment yet, simply cancel the invoice. If payment was received, you'll need to arrange refund directly with the scholarship provider according to their policies.

**Do I need to be a registered business?**
Requirements vary by scholarship program. Some accept invoices from informal groups while others require an EIN and formal business status. Check with common providers in your area.

**Can I customize invoice templates?**
The invoice format is standardized to meet scholarship provider requirements. You can customize your organization information and instructions, but not the overall layout.
