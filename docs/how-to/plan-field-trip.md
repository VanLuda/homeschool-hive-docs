# How Do I Plan a Homeschool Field Trip?

Field trips are one of the most enriching parts of homeschooling, offering hands-on learning experiences that bring curriculum to life. Homeschool Hive makes planning group field trips simple with built-in tools for managing RSVPs, collecting payments, tracking capacity, and communicating with families.

## Quick Answer

To plan a homeschool field trip, go to your group page, click **Create Event**, and fill in the event details including date, location, description, and ticket pricing. Set capacity limits based on the venue's requirements, configure RSVP settings, and publish the event. Members can then register and pay directly through the platform.

## Before You Begin

Successful field trips require advance planning. Consider these factors before creating your event:

**Venue Research:**
- Contact the venue about group rates and discounts
- Ask about minimum and maximum group sizes
- Inquire about required adult-to-child ratios
- Confirm available dates and times
- Request educational materials or guided tour options

**Logistics Planning:**
- Determine transportation (carpool, bus, meet there)
- Plan for meals and snacks
- Consider bathroom availability and breaks
- Prepare for weather contingencies (outdoor venues)
- Identify nearby parking options

**Budget Considerations:**
- Venue admission costs per person
- Group discount availability
- Additional fees (parking, materials, food)
- Whether to charge families or subsidize from group funds
