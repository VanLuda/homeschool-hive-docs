# How Do I Price Events for My Homeschool Group?

Setting the right price for your homeschool group events can feel challenging. Price too high and families may not participate. Price too low and you cannot cover costs or compensate instructors fairly. This guide will help you develop a pricing strategy that works for your group and the families you serve.

## Quick Answer

To price events effectively, calculate your total costs (venue, materials, instructor fees), divide by your minimum expected attendance, then add a small buffer for unexpected expenses. Consider offering member discounts of 10-20% to encourage membership, and use Homeschool Hive's ticket tiers to create flexible pricing options for different family sizes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Calculate Your True Costs

Before setting any price, understand exactly what the event will cost to run:

- **Venue fees**: Rental costs, deposits, or facility fees
- **Materials and supplies**: Craft supplies, science equipment, printed materials
- **Instructor compensation**: Fair payment for teachers or workshop leaders
- **Administrative costs**: Payment processing fees (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
- **Insurance or permits**: Any required coverage or permissions
- **Contingency buffer**: Add 10-15% for unexpected expenses

### 2. Determine Your Break-Even Point

Divide your total costs by the number of participants needed to cover expenses:

**Example:**
- Total event cost: $200
- Expected attendance: 20 children
- Break-even price: $10 per child

This is your minimum price. You will likely want to price above this to account for lower-than-expected attendance.

### 3. Set Up Ticket Tiers in Homeschool Hive

Use the ticketing system to create flexible pricing options:

- **Standard ticket**: Your base price for non-members
- **Member ticket**: Discounted rate for group members (typically 10-20% off)
- **Family ticket**: Discounted rate for families bringing multiple children
- **Sibling discount**: Reduced price for additional children from the same family

See [Tickets and Pricing](/docs/group-leaders/tickets-pricing) for detailed instructions on configuring ticket types.

### 4. Consider Your Group's Philosophy

Different groups approach pricing differently:

**Cost-Recovery Model**
- Price events to exactly cover costs
- Keep homeschooling affordable for all families
- May require more volunteer support

**Sustainable Model**
- Price slightly above costs
- Build a reserve for future expenses or scholarships
- Can compensate leaders and instructors fairly

**Value-Based Model**
- Price based on the value provided, not just costs
- Higher prices can signal quality
- Allows for premium programming and materials

### 5. Research Comparable Pricing

Look at what similar activities cost in your area:

- Local museum or nature center programs
- Community recreation department classes
- Private learning centers or tutoring services
- Other homeschool co-ops (if they share pricing publicly)

Your pricing should generally be competitive with or below these alternatives, given that homeschool groups are typically volunteer-run.

### 6. Create Discount Codes Strategically

Use discount codes to incentivize desired behaviors:

- **Early bird discounts**: Encourage advance registration for better planning
- **Referral codes**: Reward members who bring new families
- **Loyalty discounts**: Thank families who attend regularly
- **Scholarship codes**: Provide reduced rates for families in need

### 7. Communicate Value Clearly

Help families understand what their payment covers:

- **Itemize included materials** in your event description
- **Highlight instructor qualifications** if applicable
- **Explain what makes this event special** compared to free alternatives
- **Be transparent** about where the money goes

## Tips

:::tip Test and Adjust
Start with your best estimate and adjust based on response. If events consistently sell out quickly, you may be underpricing. If attendance is low despite interest, consider reducing prices or adding more value.
:::

:::tip Offer Sliding Scale Options
Some groups offer "pay what you can" or suggested donation models for certain events. This maximizes participation while allowing those who can pay more to support others.
:::

:::tip Bundle for Value
Consider offering event packages (like a semester of weekly classes) at a discounted rate. This provides predictable revenue and encourages commitment from families.
:::

:::warning Account for No-Shows
Unfortunately, some registered families will not attend. Consider requiring payment at registration (rather than at the door) to reduce no-shows and ensure you cover costs.
:::

:::note Payment Processing Fees
Remember that Homeschool Hive and Stripe charge payment processing fees. Factor these into your pricing or note them as a separate line item. See [Payments and Stripe](/docs/group-leaders/payments-stripe) for details.

## Sample Pricing Scenarios

### Low-Cost Park Day
- Venue: Free public park
- Materials: $20 for simple craft supplies
- Participants: 15 children
- **Suggested price**: $2-3 per child (covers materials with small buffer)

### Science Workshop with Instructor
- Venue: $50 community center rental
- Materials: $75 for experiment supplies
- Instructor: $100 for 2-hour workshop
- Participants: 20 children

## Common Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting payment processing fees**: These add up quickly
2. **Underestimating materials**: Art and science supplies are expensive
3. **Not valuing volunteer time**: While not a cash cost, it has real value
4. **Pricing the same for all events**: Different events have different costs
5. **Ignoring the market**: Being significantly out of line with comparable options
