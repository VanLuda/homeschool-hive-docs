# How Do I Track Homeschool Attendance?

Tracking attendance is essential for many homeschool families and co-ops, whether for state reporting requirements, scholarship documentation, or simply monitoring participation. Homeschool Hive provides built-in tools to track attendance at events, generate reports, and maintain records for your homeschool group.

## Quick Answer

To track homeschool attendance, use the **Check-In** feature on any event page. As attendees arrive, search for their name and click **Check In**. View real-time statistics, filter by status, and export attendance reports in CSV or PDF format for your records.

## Why Track Attendance?

Attendance tracking serves multiple purposes for homeschool groups:

**Compliance and Documentation:**
- Meet state homeschool reporting requirements
- Document participation for umbrella schools
- Provide records for scholarship programs
- Support grant applications or funding requests

**Group Management:**
- Verify who actually attended vs. who registered
- Identify engagement patterns
- Plan future events based on attendance trends
- Follow up with families who miss multiple sessions

**Safety and Accountability:**
- Know exactly who is present at any time
- Have accurate headcounts for emergencies
- Track adult-to-child ratios

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access the Check-In Feature

**For Single Events:**
1. Navigate to your event page
2. Click **Manage Event** in the event menu
3. Select **Check-In** or **Attendance** from the admin panel
4. The check-in interface displays all registered attendees

**For Series Events (recurring classes, ongoing programs):**
1. Go to your series event page
2. Click **Manage Series**
3. Find the specific session date
4. Click **Check-In** for that session

:::tip Quick Access
Bookmark the check-in page on your mobile device before your event. This provides fast access when families start arriving.
:::

### Step 2: Understand the Check-In Interface

The check-in screen shows key information at a glance:

**Statistics Overview:**
- **Total** - Total number of registered attendees
- **Checked In** - How many have arrived
- **Pending** - Attendees not yet checked in
- **No Show** - Attendees marked as absent

**Progress Bar:**
- Visual green bar that fills as you check people in
- Shows completion percentage
- Updates in real-time

**Attendee List:**
- Names with profile avatars
- Access type badges (ticket type, series pass)
- Current status with timestamps
- Action buttons for each person

### Step 3: Check In Attendees as They Arrive

When a family arrives at your event:

1. **Search for their name** - Type in the search bar to quickly find them
2. **Click the green "Check In" button** - Located next to their name
3. **Confirmation appears** - Status updates to show check-in time
4. **Repeat** for each family member or attendee

The system automatically records:
- Exact check-in timestamp
- Who performed the check-in
- Updated running statistics

### Step 4: Use Filters to Manage the List

For larger events, filter the attendee list by status:

- **All** - View everyone registered
- **Pending** - Only show people who have not checked in yet
- **Checked In** - Only show people who have arrived
- **No Show** - Only show people marked as absent

Use the **Pending** filter during active check-in to focus only on families you are still waiting for.

### Step 5: Handle Special Situations

**Undo an Accidental Check-In:**
1. Find the person in the list
2. Click the **Undo** button (appears after check-in)
3. Their status returns to Pending

**Mark a No-Show:**
After the event starts, mark families who did not attend:
1. Filter to show **Pending** attendees
2. Click the **X** icon next to absent attendees
3. Status changes to No Show

**Late Arrivals:**
If someone was marked as no-show but arrives late:
1. Click **Reset** to return them to Pending
2. Click **Check In** as normal

### Step 6: Track Series Attendance

For recurring events like weekly co-op classes, track attendance across all sessions:

**How Series Check-In Works:**
- Each session has its own separate check-in
- Series pass holders appear on every session's list
- Attendance is tracked per session, not just once for the series
- Drop-in attendees appear only on their registered sessions

**Viewing Attendance Patterns:**
- See which families attended which sessions
- Identify perfect attendance
- Notice patterns (lower attendance on certain dates)
- Follow up with families who miss multiple sessions

### Step 7: Export Attendance Reports

Generate reports for your records, scholarship programs, or co-op documentation.

**Single Event Reports:**

1. Go to the event page
2. Click **Manage Event** > **Attendance**
3. Click **Attendance Report** or **Export**
4. Choose your format:

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **CSV** | Importing to spreadsheets, further analysis |
| **Print/PDF** | Physical records, official documentation |

**CSV Reports Include:**
- Attendee names
- Email addresses
- Access type (ticket type, series pass)
- Check-in status
- Check-in timestamps
- Summary statistics

**PDF Reports Include:**
- Event name and date
- Group name
- Formatted attendee roster
- Check-in status for each person
- Summary statistics
- Professional layout for printing

**Series Reports:**

For event series, generate two report types:

**Roster Report:**
- Shows attendee list with check-in details
- Can select all sessions combined or a specific session
- Includes names, contact info, access type, and status

**Summary Report:**
- Shows attendance statistics across the entire series
- Session-by-session breakdown
- Check-in count vs. total count per session
- Attendance rate percentages
- Overall statistics:
  - Total unique attendees
  - Average attendance per session
  - Overall attendance rate

## Using Attendance for Homeschool Records

### State Reporting

Many states require attendance documentation for homeschooling. Use Homeschool Hive attendance records to:

- Document co-op class participation
- Track enrichment activity attendance
- Maintain records of educational field trips
- Demonstrate consistent educational engagement

### Scholarship Documentation

For families using scholarship funds (ESA, tax credit scholarships):

- Export attendance reports as proof of participation
- Provide PDF records with dates and activities
- Document attendance at approved educational events

### Co-op Requirements

If your co-op has attendance policies:

- Track which families meet participation requirements
- Identify families who may need follow-up
- Generate end-of-year attendance summaries
- Document volunteer or teaching participation

## Tips

- **Charge your device** before events to ensure you have battery for check-in
- **Download a backup list** before the event in case of technology issues
- **Designate a check-in volunteer** for large events so you can focus on other responsibilities
- **Check yourself in first** to test that the system is working
- **Export reports regularly** to maintain backup records
- **Use the calendar** as a secondary attendance record by tracking which events your family attended
- **Set up series passes** for recurring classes to simplify tracking across multiple sessions

:::note Calendar Integration
Your personal calendar on Homeschool Hive shows all events you have attended. This provides an additional way to review your family's participation history.
