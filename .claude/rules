# Homeschool Hive Documentation Rules

## Security-Conscious Content Policy

All public-facing content (changelogs, documentation, blog posts) must avoid exposing information that could help malicious actors.

### Never Include

1. **Timeframes and Thresholds**
   - Session durations (e.g., "sessions expire after 1 hour")
   - Token expiration times
   - Rate limiting thresholds
   - Retry delays or lockout periods

2. **Implementation Details**
   - URL parameters (e.g., "?discount=CODE", "?token=...")
   - API endpoints or routes
   - File paths or directory structures
   - Database schema or table names
   - Authentication mechanisms (session caching, token refresh patterns)

3. **Security Mechanisms**
   - Defensive measures (rate limiting, webhook protection, CSRF tokens)
   - Validation rules or regex patterns
   - Error handling strategies
   - Encryption or hashing methods

4. **Vulnerability Information**
   - Specific vulnerability types (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.)
   - Attack vectors that were fixed
   - Security patches with technical details

### Safe Alternatives

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Fixed session timeout after 1 hour" | "Fixed unexpected logout issue" |
| "Links expire after 1 hour" | "Links include time-limited access" |
| "Added rate limiting (100 req/min)" | "Enhanced platform security" |
| "Apply discount via ?discount=CODE" | "Apply discount codes during checkout" |
| "Fixed XSS in user comments" | "Improved content security" |
| "Webhook deduplication prevents replay" | "Improved payment reliability" |
| "JWT tokens now rotate every 15 min" | "Improved session security" |

### General Principle

Describe **what users experience**, not **how it's implemented**. Users care about "faster logins" not "session caching with Redis".

## Content Standards

- No emojis in changelogs or formal documentation
- User-focused language over technical jargon
- Describe symptoms for bug fixes, not root causes
- Keep security-related entries vague but reassuring

## Themed Images

When adding images that need different versions for light and dark mode, use Docusaurus's built-in `ThemedImage` component:

```mdx
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

<ThemedImage
  alt="Description of the image"
  sources={{
    light: 'https://assets.homeschoolhive.co/docs/example-light.png',
    dark: 'https://assets.homeschoolhive.co/docs/example-dark.png',
  }}
/>
```

- Images are hosted on AWS at `https://assets.homeschoolhive.co/docs/`
- Use descriptive filenames with `-light` and `-dark` suffixes
- Always include meaningful `alt` text for accessibility
